Research has demonstrated a link between alcohol use and multiple forms of risky sexual behavior, particularly among college-age individuals. Studies have also linked heavy alcohol use to other problems, such as impaired consciousness resulting from an alcohol-induced blackout, which may impact sexual decision making. However, research has rarely examined sexual risk taking (SRT) in relation to blackouts, nor has it examined this construct during the precollege transition (i.e., the interval of time between high school graduation and college matriculation). This study examined the intersection between alcohol-involved SRT, blackouts, and gender in a sample of precollege individuals with prior alcohol use (N = 229; 54% male, 63% White). Results indicated that, despite drinking less per occasion, women reporting recent blackouts were at increased risk for experiencing unwanted, unsafe, and regretted sexual behaviors compared to men with recent blackouts and their peers with no recent blackouts. Women with recent blackouts also reported differences in alcohol expectancies that may increase their risk for experiencing negative consequences while drinking, including higher social expectancies and lower negative expectancies of danger. Future directions for research and implications for precollege interventions are discussed.
 Alcohol use is highly prevalent in adolescents and a proximal risk factor for engagement in risky sexual beha- vior (Cooper, 2006; Desiderato & Crawford, 1995; Grello, Welsh, & Harper, 2006; Halpern-Felsher, Millstein, & Ellen, 1996; Mair, Ponicki, & Gruenewald, 2016). Sexual risk taking (SRT) while drinking is preva- lent in adolescents and emerging adults and includes a wide range of behaviors, ranging from indiscriminate activities (e.g., multiple sex partners, unplanned sexual activity) to ones where an individual neglects protective actions against pregnancy and sexually transmitted dis- eases (STDs) (e.g., not using a condom) (Cooper, 2002). Though risky sexual acts occur in both intoxicated and sober individuals, drinking potentiates the risk for enga- ging in sexual behaviors with negative repercussions by a variety of means. These include lowering inhibitions

(Coleman & Cater, 2005) and activating social, personal, and sexual scripts about the role of alcohol in sexual encounters (Berntson, Hoffman, & Luff, 2014; Simon & Gagnon, 1984). In addition, drinking can impair decision making and encoding of memories around a drinking event, as is the case with alcohol-related blackouts (ARBs).
Much of the research on SRT while intoxicated and blackouts has occurred in silos, emphasizing either black- outs or SRT. Studies that have examined these constructs together have shown a link between alcohol-related black- outs and several risky sexual activities (Martinez, Sher, & Wood, 2014; Orchowski, Mastroleo, & Borsari, 2012). Despite this link, there is scant research examining the extent to which alcohol-related SRT varies vis-à-vis differ- ences in both gender and recent blackout incidence. Similarly, much of the extant research has focused on individuals already in college and has not examined SRT and blackouts during the transition between high school graduation and college entry. The purpose of this study was to expand the current research on blackouts and SRT by examining gender differences in three risky sexual activities during the interval between high school gradua- tion and college entry (i.e., “precollege”). In the following sections, we briefly review the literature on both alcohol- related SRT and blackouts in precollege and college
 
samples, as well as the role of alcohol expectancies and significance of examining this issue prior to college matriculation.
Sexual Risk Taking and Alcohol Use
By the time adolescents are high school seniors, over two- thirds have had sexual intercourse, with one in three reporting recent activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Many adolescents, including college freshmen, engage in sexual behaviors while under the influence of alcohol, placing them at increased risk for negative conse- quences from sexual encounters (Mair et al., 2016). Alcohol- related SRT refers to a variety of behaviors that increase the likelihood of experiencing a negative consequence associated with sexual contact, including unsafe, unplanned, or regretted sexual acts. These behaviors can lead to many negative out- comes, including STDs, unwanted/unplanned pregnancy, and increased risk for sexual victimization (Abbey, Ross, McDuffie, & McAuslan, 1996; Leigh & Stall, 1993).
The prevalence of SRT while drinking is particularly high among matriculated college students, who may have greater independence and sexual opportunities than their high school peers (Barnett et al., 2014). In fact, one study found that rates of alcohol-related SRT increased by over 5% from high school to college (Orchowski & Barnett, 2012). However, women may be at disproportionate risk for experiencing these adverse effects. For example, using two SRT behaviors (unplanned and unsafe sex), Mair and colleagues (2016) noted that, among alcohol users, women reported a higher prevalence relative to college men. Other studies examining alcohol-related regretted sex have shown comparable patterns (Barnett et al., 2014; Orchowski et al., 2012). In one study, 32% of college students reported alco- hol-related regretted sex, with women showing 67% greater odds than their male counterparts (Barnett et al., 2014). Correspondingly, event-level research has shown that women with higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) experience greater negative sexual consequences than their peers with lower levels (Scaglione et al., 2014).
Alcohol-Related Blackouts
Another consequence associated with higher BAC levels is the occurrence of blackouts (Ryback, 1970). Blackouts are characterized by amnesia during the intoxication episode in which individuals are able to engage in salient, emotional events of which they have no memory later (White, Jamieson-Drake, & Swartzwelder, 2002) and which occur from a rapid rise in BAC typically brought on by drinking too quickly or ingesting excess quantities of alcohol (Lee, Roh, & Kim, 2009). Amnesia results from a disruption in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus which pro- duces impairment in encoding of new information while under the influence (Schummers & Browning, 2001; White,
2003). Blackouts can occur for an entire drinking event (en bloc) or for partial events (fragmentary blackouts or “gray- outs”) (Perry et al., 2006; Rose & Grant, 2010). Fragmentary blackouts are more commonly reported, and persons can activate some retrieval with effective cueing. Conversely, en bloc blackouts produce complete amnesia resulting in perma- nent, irretrievable memory loss (Lee et al., 2009).
Blackouts are one of the most common consequences reported by adolescents and college student drinkers (Barnett et al., 2014; Hingson, Zha, Simons-Morton, & White, 2016). A recent study reported that 66% of college students reported at least one blackout in the past three years (Marino & Fromme, 2015) and another study found recent (i.e., past two weeks) blackout incidence to be 12% among precollege individuals (White & Swartzwelder, 2009). Multiple factors contribute to blackout risk, including drink- ing hard alcohol (White, 2003) and engaging in drinking styles that promote rapid ingestion (e.g., pregaming; LaBrie, Hummer, Kenney, Lac, & Pedersen, 2011). There is also evidence supporting a biological propensity for blackouts, either through genetic susceptibility (Hartzler & Fromme, 2003b; White, 2003) or as a sequela of damage resulting from prior heavy drinking (Wetherill & Fromme, 2011).
Another risk factor is biological sex. Women are physically smaller than men and have differences in alcohol metabolism that lead to higher BACs even with amounts of alcohol scaled according to body weight (Rose & Grant, 2010). Though men and women report comparable rates of blackout incidence, these aforementioned differences in pharmacokinetics place females at an increased risk for blackouts despite lower levels of alcohol involvement (Barnett et al., 2014).
Blackouts and Alcohol-Related Sexual Risk Taking
Blackouts are a significant consequence by themselves, yet few have directly examined blackout incidence in relation to other risky sexual acts that may place an indi- vidual at increased risk for negative consequences (e.g., health concerns from unprotected sex). Available studies highlight the scope of the problem but have focused pre- dominantly on epidemiological studies or aggregated SRT behaviors into a single construct of sexual consequences. For example, a large-scale, multisite epidemiological study estimated that as many as 110,000 college students reported being too intoxicated to say whether they had consented to sex (Hingson, Zha, & Weitzman, 2009). Another study examining blackouts and sexual conse- quences found that approximately 25% of both male and female students who had blacked out engaged in some form of sexual activity (White et al., 2002) but did not further distinguish that activity into specific risky sexual acts. Other studies have shown the link between incapaci- tation due to high BACs and unwanted sexual activity (Kilpatrick, Resnick, Ruggiero, Conoscenti, & McCauley, 2007; Testa, Livingston, Vanzile-Tamsen, & Frone, 2003) as well as risky sexual practices (e.g., hooking up; Flack
2
HAAS, BARTHEL, AND TAYLOR
et al., 2007). However, these studies did not examine blackouts in relation to discrete SRT behaviors. As such, there is a clear need to explore the link between recent alcohol-related blackout activity, gender, and SRT while under the influence.
Alcohol Expectancies and Sexual Risk Taking
Another risk factor of both SRT and blackouts are expectancies that promote sexual facilitation and/or hea- vier consumption. Alcohol expectancies refer to the antici- pated outcomes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) that an individual has about the effects of alcohol use (Goldman, Brown, Christiansen, & Smith, 1991). Prior studies have found an association between positive expec- tancies (e.g., social, global positive) with blackouts (Hartzler & Fromme, 2003a) as well as SRT (Leigh, 1990). As such, there are proximal risk factors that influ- ence perceptions about the role alcohol plays in the facil- itation of and/or enhancement of sexual experiences. For example, studies have found a link between sexual expec- tancies and drinking before sexual encounters (White, Fleming, Catalano, & Bailey, 2009), number of sexual partners (Hendershot, Stoner, George, & Norris, 2007), beliefs related to unsafe sex outcomes (Abbey, Saenz, & Buck, 2005), and sexual victimization (Corbin, Bernat, Calhoun, McNair, & Seals, 2001). Dose-dependent effects were reported by Stappenbeck et al. (2013) who reported sexual enhancement expectancies were highest among moderate and heavy episodic (i.e., binge) drinkers, with heavy episodic drinkers, in turn, engaging in greater SRT relative to other classes of alcohol users. Some studies have suggested that SRT was mediated by disinhibition resulting from higher levels of global positive expectancies (Fromme, Katz, & D’Amico, 1997) as well as alcohol consumption consistent with intoxication (BAC of .08 or greater; Fromme, D’Amico, & Katz, 1999). However, others have posited that expectancies are the mediator between use and SRT, with individuals who report higher levels of sexual facilitation expectancies engaging in greater SRT (Carey, Durney, Shepardson, & Carey, 2015; Fromme et al., 1999). Based on both conceptualizations, there does appear to be a link between anticipated positive effects from alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, parti- cularly expectancies of sexual enhancement or facilitation.
Importance of Examining Sexual Risk Taking and Blackouts in Precollege Students
The majority of research on alcohol-related SRT and blackouts has been conducted on young adults who have already matriculated into college. However, there is growing evidence that risky behaviors are increasing prior to college entry, during the transition from high school to higher education. For example, increases during the precollege
time frame have been noted for both risky sexual activities (Fromme, Corbin, & Kruse, 2008; Olmstead, Roberson, Pasley, & Fincham, 2015) and alcohol consumption (Haas, Smith, Kagan, & Jacob, 2012; Hartzler & Fromme, 2003c; Read, Wardell, & Bachrach, 2013; Sher & Rutledge, 2007). Given the pro-drinking culture present on U.S. college campuses today, coupled with lower levels of parental mon- itoring, individuals who are having problems precollege may be at a heightened risk for more severe problems and negative consequences as first-year students relative to their peers with lower propensities for drinking.
The Current Study
The current study was designed to further the literature combining SRT and problematic alcohol consumption. As shown in the aforementioned review, heavy drinking has been linked to both SRT and blackouts; however, few studies have examined how these constructs together con- tribute to different risk for SRT while drinking, either by group (blackout versus not) or further stratified by gender. Likewise, though there is a growing body of research examining multiple forms of SRT in college samples, rela- tively few studies have examined this issue in college- bound students who have not yet made the transition to college living. Given the increased attention being paid to sexual victimization on campuses today, information regarding precollege SRT would be valuable for better understanding the kinds of SRT behaviors new students are already practicing, as well as for helping campus health professionals develop effective prevention and intervention programming.
Primary goals for this study were to identify alcohol- related blackout incidence as a significant correlate of SRT while intoxicated and provide descriptive information regarding differences in alcohol consumption, problems, and expectancies by gender. New college students with recent alcohol use were stratified into four groups, with gender (male/female) crossed with past three-month black- out incidence [occurred (ARB+) versus did not (ARB−)]. Consumption and SRT behaviors were assessed for the three months preceding college entry. Based on the extant literature we hypothesized the following:
H1: We anticipated greater alcohol consumption (quantity and drinking days per month) among individuals with recent blackouts, with women ARB+ consuming less than their male ARB+ peers. Furthermore, we hypothesized that ARB + status would be associated with risker drinking overall as measured by binge drinking and pregaming.
H2: There would be corresponding differences in alcohol expectancies, such that ARB+ individuals would report greater social and sexual expectancies, and reduced negative expectancies of danger, compared to ARB− individuals even when controlling for overall consumption. Within the

ARB+ groups, women would have stronger expectancies of social and sexual facilitation, and lower negative expectan- cies of danger compared to men.
H3: Alcohol-related blackouts would have a unique contri- bution to SRT above and beyond consumption, with higher rates of SRT reported by ARB+ women.
Method Procedure and Participants
Entering college freshmen from a West Coast, private uni- versity were recruited into the study during a university-spon- sored welcome event immediately preceding the first day of classes in September 2011. Three of the seven campus resi- dential learning communities were selected at random to pro- vide a representative sample, and affiliated students were escorted to the recruitment session by residence hall staff. Individuals were informed of the inclusion criteria (i.e., age 18 or older and willing to provide written consent), notified of purpose and duration of the study, and invited to participate. Interested, eligible students then completed written informed consent followed by a 15-minute paper-and-pencil assessment. Trained research assistants were available to answer questions and review the questionnaires for completeness. A $5 gift card was provided upon completion as incentive. All study proce- dures received institutional review board (IRB) approval at the performance site and lead investigator’s institution prior to data collection.
Questionnaires were completed by over 85% of students attending the recruitment session (N = 315). However, because the study examined variations in alcohol-related conse- quences, the final sample was restricted to individuals report- ing alcohol use in the past three months (n = 229; 72.7% of all participants). Participants were of traditional college age (M = 18.16 years) and relatively diverse (54.2% men; 62.9% White, 12.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, 15.7% Latino/a, 2.6% Black, and 6.2% other/not disclosed). Comparison with uni- versity demographics and prior studies conducted at this site (Haas, Smith, Kagan, & Jacob, 2012; Haas, Kagan, & Smith, 2013; Haas, Wickham, & Gibbs, 2016) indicated that the sample was representative of the overall university census with regard to gender and ethnic composition.
Measures
Demographics. Participants self-reported age, sex, ethnicity, current living arrangements, intention to rush a fraternity or sorority, and age of first alcohol use.
Current Alcohol Use. Participants were presented with a chart depicting standard drink equivalents (i.e., 1.5 ounces of hard alcohol, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces beer) and asked to report drinking behaviors in the summer between high school
graduation and college matriculation. Items assessed typical quantity (“How many total drinks do you usually consume per occasion when you drink [over the course of the entire night, day, or occasion that you are drinking]?”; continuously scaled) and frequency [“During this past summer how often did you drink alcohol?”; 13-point Likert ranging from 0 = Never to 12 = Daily]. The frequency item lent itself to transposition into days drinking, which was used in the study analyses. Separate, comparable items assessed past 30-day use to generate a Quantity-Frequency Index score (QFI; Cahalan, Cisin, & Crossley, 1969), with higher scores indicative of greater overall alcohol involvement. Binge-drinker status was operationalized using the 5/4 criteria (i.e., 5 or more drinks for men/4 or more drinks for women on one occasion in the past two weeks; Wechsler, Dowdall, Davenport, & Rimm, 1995). Pregaming and drinking game participation were measured using a single item asking participants to report the percentage of overall drinking events involving the practice, which was dichotomized (no pregaming, pregaming) for use in the analyses.
Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (Sample α = .88). Past-year incidence of alcohol problems was assessed using the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI; White & Labouvie, 2000), an 18-item self-report measure with responses scored from 0 = Never to 3 = Happened more than five times. Two of the items on the scale assessed symptoms consistent with blackouts or impaired consciousness (e.g., “Suddenly found yourself in a place that you could not remember getting to”; “passed out or fainted suddenly”). To avoid criterion contamination, these items were removed and a modified RAPI (blackout items omitted, 16 items total) was used for the study analyses.
Alcohol-Related Risky Sexual Behaviors and Blackout Items. Four separate items assessed past three-month incidence of alcohol-related SRT and blackouts using a using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = Never to 3 = Happened frequently. Participants self-reported engaging in “unplanned sexual activity while drinking,” “unsafe sex while drinking or drunk,” or “had a sexual encounter while drinking that you later regretted” (sample α = .72). A separate item assessed ARB using the stem “forgot where you are or what you did (blackouts).” These items were part of a larger, investigator-generated scale assessing alcohol-related problems common among college students and have been used in prior studies (Haas et al., 2012; Haas et al., 2013; Haas et al., 2016).
Alcohol Expectancy Inventory. Expectancies were measured using subscales of the Alcohol Expectancy Inventory (AEI; Darkes & Goldman, 1997) The AEI is a 24- item measure containing 24 expectancy words assessing positive and negative expectancies in multidimensional space (arousing-sedating crossed with positive-negative vectors). Participants respond to each word using the stem “Drinking alcohol makes one _________” on a 7-point scale ranging from

HAAS, BARTHEL, AND TAYLOR
Never to Always. This study utilized two three-word subscales representing positive expectancies [sexual facilitation (“horny”; sample α = .75) and social (α = .85)] and one arousing, negative expectancy (“dangerousness,” α = .80).
Data Analyses
Preliminary analyses were conducted to evaluate item frequencies and distributions. One variable (QFI) was not normally distributed (skew = 2.40; kurtosis = 5.70) and was square-root transformed for use in the regression analyses per the recommendations specified by Tabachnick and Fidell (2013). Less than 10% of participants reported multiple inci- dences of individual SRT behaviors, and these variables were dummy-coded [occurred (+) or did not occur (−)] for use in subsequent analyses. Similarly, multiple incidents of ARB were infrequent (7.8% of sample; n = 20), and a grouping variable was created by dichotomizing responses (0 = ARB−; 1–3 collapsed to single category of ARB+). Evaluation of group differences in drinking characteristics and alcohol expectancies was conducted using a series of 2 × 2 (gender × ARB status) analyses of variance (ANOVAs) or analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs). Other analyses (i.e., chi-square and logistic regressions) were done by stratifying participants into four groups based on gender and ARB status: male ARB− (n = 80), female ARB− (n = 74), male ARB+ (n = 44), and female ARB+ (n = 31). Analyses to address the study hypoth- eses are described in further detail in the next section.
Results Sample Characteristics
Alcohol use characteristics for the entire sample are summar- ized in Table 1. On average, participants reported 4.9 drinks per occasion, with 54% having at least one binge episode in the past two weeks. The modal participant reported less than monthly consumption; however, 15% were drinking on three or more days per week. Pregaming and drinking game participation, two drinking styles associated with rapid consumption and hard alcohol use, were highly prevalent (64% and 78%, respectively). Blackouts were the most prevalent alcohol-related consequence measured in the current study (35%), followed by risky sexual behaviors of unplanned (31%), regretted (17.5), and unsafe sex (12.7). Overall, 34.9% (n = 80) of participants reported at least one risky sexual behavior; a minority (7%, n = 16) endorsed all three.
Hypothesis 1: Comparing Overall Alcohol Involvement by Gender and Blackout Status
Differences in alcohol consumption and problems were examined using a series of 2 × 2 ANOVAs that evaluated group differences in overall alcohol use and problems. Group means and results are presented in Table 2. Main effects were

found for gender for most of the drinking indices, with men consuming more alcohol per occasion, on more occasions, and having more problems than women. Comparable results were found for ARB, with participants reporting recent black- outs consuming more and having additional problems. Gender-by-ARB interaction effects were found for all con- sumption indices. Male ARB+ students drank nearly twice as often as their female ARB+ peers and consumed more drinks per occasion. Though not statistically significant, male ARB+ students and reported more alcohol-related consequences as measured by the RAPI (p = .10). No differences were found (main effects or interaction) for age of first use.
Two chi-square analyses were conducted to examine differences in point prevalence of recent binge drinking and pregaming activities. As shown in Figure 1, results indicated differences in risky drinking practices but were constrained to differences by blackout incidence with both binge drinking and pregaming rates two- to threefold higher for students with recent blackouts, χ2 (3, N = 226) = 65.92 and 61.81, respectively, ps < .001.
Hypothesis 2: Differences in Alcohol Expectancies
Group means for the expectancy domains are presented in the lower portion of Table 2. Three 2 × 2 ANCOVAs were used to evaluate differences in expectancies while controlling for overall consumption using QFI. Results indicated that women had greater expectancies of dangerousness than men, and ARB positive status was related to greater social expectancies. No interaction effects were observed.

Hypothesis 3: Predicting Alcohol-Related Risky Sexual Behavior by Gender and ARB Status
Logistic regression analyses evaluated differences in the prevalence of alcohol-related risky sexual behaviors as a function of overall drinking and gender-by-ARB group membership. Separate models were conducted for each sex- ual behavior (i.e., regretted, unsafe, and unplanned), with men reporting no blackouts (male ARB−) used as the refer- ence group for comparison. Overall alcohol involvement (QFI, square root corrected) was entered in Step 1 to control for consumption differences between the gender-by-ARB categories. Interitem correlations are presented in Table 3. Regression results are summarized in Table 4.
All three models were statistically significant and cor- rectly classified 77% or more of all cases. A similar pattern emerged across the analyses. When entered alone, overall alcohol use was a significant predictor of each risky sexual behavior in Step 1 (all ps < .001). However, a consistent pattern of group differences emerged, even when overall use was statistically controlled. Men and women who reported no blackouts had relatively equal risk for engaging in regretted, unsafe, or unplanned sex (OR = 0.88, 1.60, and 1.17, respectively). Men with recent blackouts (ARB+) reported slightly higher but nonsignificant risk relative to their male peers with no recent blackouts (ARB−) (all OR < 1.55). However, women with recent blackout activity showed a different pattern. Relative to male ARB−

Overall, findings validated prior studies indicating that women were at greater risk for SRT, but provided additional information about the incre- mental increase in risk women have when they engage in drinking sufficient to produce blackouts. Compared to men with no recent blackouts, women with recent blackouts were three to five times more likely to engage in SRT while drinking on all indices (unsafe, unplanned, and regretted), whereas men with a history of blackouts, and women with no blackouts, were only moderately at risk (all OR < 1.75). However, this risk taking for women with recent blackouts occurred in the context of lower levels of alcohol use and greater expectancies of dangerousness from alcohol. Consistent with prior studies (White et al., 2002), women with recent blackouts reported significantly less overall alcohol involvement and fewer aggregate alcohol-related problems than men reporting blackouts. Similarly, within the blackout conditions, no differences were found for risky drinking styles like binge consumption, pregaming, or drinking-game participation. Overall, results provide compelling evidence that blackout incidence increases the risk for SRT in women who drink.
One reason for investigating alcohol-related blackouts and gender in relation to SRT is the increasing concern over college student sexual health issues. Adolescents and college students represent nearly one-fourth of the new cases of STDs each year in the United States (Scholly, Katz, Gascoigne, & Holck, 2005). Results from this study

indicated that nearly 40% of the sample had engaged in unsafe or unplanned sexual activity in the past three months while drinking. These risky sexual behaviors increase the likelihood of an individual failing to use protection (e.g. condom use), which contributes to negative consequences such as unplanned pregnancy and STDs. An increase in number of sexual partners from unplanned sexual activity and unsafe practices are both known to increase the prob- ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure (Fromme et al., 1999). Unwanted or unplanned pregnancies are potentially life-changing consequences that can impact a student’s academic success. As such, women are dispropor- tionally experiencing negative burdens due to unplanned pregnancies.
In addition to the sexual health concerns, understanding alcohol-related blackouts and SRT in this population is of importance due to the challenges associated with being young adults. Often referred to as transitional youth, as they have left adolescence but have yet to grasp the responsibilities of adulthood (Arnett, 2000; Hicks & Heastie, 2008), the uncertainty and instability in the lives of young adults makes this population a concern of its own (Arnett, 2007). Issues of concern for these transitional youth include renegotiating family relationships and sup- port, forming new peer relationships, (Hicks & Heastie, 2008), coping with loss of high school friends (Cleary, Walter, & Jackson, 2011), psychological health issues, identity exploration, exploration of romantic relationships, and increases in experimentation (Arnett, 2000). Several types of risky behaviors peak during ages 18 to 25, includ- ing unprotected sex, substance use, and risky driving beha- viors (Arnett, 2000). These risky behaviors can be understood through an identity exploration lens as young people desire to have diverse experiences before obtaining the responsibilities and commitments that come with an adult life. The transition out of their childhood home is the first opportunity many of these young adults have to indi- viduate and explore their newfound freedoms (Hicks & Heastie, 2008), giving rise to a concern for possible increased risky behaviors. Increased autonomy and a lack of monitoring by parents allow young adults to pursue their desire for new experiences (i.e., risky behaviors) more freely. Research has shown that during the transition from high school to college there are increases in both number of sexual partners and alcohol use (Fromme et al., 2008). Decreased supervision, increased freedom, and increased availability for both sexual partners and alcohol use were found to be factors contributing to the risky behaviors for young adults (Fromme et al., 2008).
Limitations and Future Directions
Although the findings of this study add to the existing literature on blackouts and SRT in college students, it is not without limitations. The current sample utilized data from a relatively understudied, high-risk group of students (i.e., entering freshmen), examined SRT during an important
developmental transition (precollege), and found modest group differences on alcohol consumption, expectancies, and problem indices, including specific SRT behaviors. Though representative of the larger student body at our study site, the sample was collected at a single site at a private university, which limits the generalizability of the results. In particular, this site has a high percentage of freshmen who would be residing on campus, and it is unclear if the same predictors would emerge if this study was conducted at a location with more commuter students who planned to reside at home. In a similar vein, we did not assess parental or participant socioeconomic status (SES) in this study, and we acknowledge that a private university in the San Francisco area may draw students who are better off financially relative to other institutions. Both of these factors could influence access to alcohol and/or social norms regarding use and sexual activity, precollege as well as upon matriculation. Future research would benefit from a multisite, multicohort, multiyear design to address cohort effect, determine behavioral changes over time, and increase generalizability across colleges in the United States.
Another potential limitation was the cross-sectional nat- ure of the data collected and the manner with which black- outs, SRT behaviors, and alcohol use were measured. This study asked separate items that evaluated alcohol consump- tion and problems during the transition from high school to college, but did not include items that would allow for event-level associations between alcohol use, blackout inci- dence, and SRT. Future research may want to consider utilizing other measures, such as a modified timeline fol- low-back interview (Sobell & Sobell, 1992), and/or data collection approaches (e.g., diary studies) to examine the intersection of these consequences within discrete drinking events. Another direction may be to examine how SRT and blackout relate to specific drinking events which involve risky styles of drinking and which have a higher probability of blackout. Prior research has identified risk factors for blackout like use of hard alcohol, chugging drinks, and restricting food on drinking days (Lee et al., 2009). Future studies should consider collecting event-level data that cap- tures risky drinking practices with these characteristics, like pregaming or drunkorexia (i.e., limiting food intake before alcohol consumption; Barry & Piazza-Gardner, 2012). In addition, this study focused on three SRT behaviors identi- fied in prior studies (unsafe, unplanned, and regretted) but did not assess other characteristics of sexuality that may differ by gender-blackout group. Future research should consider including measures that allow for a more intensive study of sexual history and recent sexual experiences. For example, alcohol use has been shown to be associated with casual sexual relationships with higher levels of SRT, like hookups, one-night stands, and friends with benefits (Grello et al., 2006; Owen & Fincham, 2011a, 2011b). Future studies may want to include measures to assess these dimen- sions as well, to provide a broader view of how blackouts and gender contribute to participation in these kinds of sexual arrangements.

Implications and Final Remarks
Overall, findings from this study provide direct implica- tions for future research, prevention, and intervention efforts. This study adds to the growing literature implicating consequences associated with escalations in overall risk taking, as well as drinking, during the precollege transition. Results highlight that SRT while drinking occurs at rela- tively high base rates during this time frame, and that black- outs and engagement in multiple kinds of SRT, including unwanted, unsafe, and regretted acts, are related through alcohol use.
Findings also emphasize that women are at greater risk, despite drinking less. As such, prevention efforts should emphasize consequences associated with alcohol use with gender differences in mind and emphasize the intersectionality between problems. Though this kind of psychoeducation occurs in many existing campus pre- vention programs through commercially available online programming, additional materials may enhance under- standing and/or integration of this information into women’s drinking and the role of alcohol in their sexual decision making. For example, campuses may want to consider creating posters or similar media with informa- tion about gender differences in alcohol metabolism, which could be posted in common areas on campus throughout the year. Comparable media could be intro- duced to highlight the problem of blackout, consent, and sexual practices engaged in while under the influence. Such media could provide education around different BACs and level of alcohol consumption for blackouts to occur in men and women, as well as dose-dependent information about when decision making and consent may be impaired. Similar campaigns have been used in conjunction with alcohol-related social norms interven- tions with some success (Glider, Midyett, Mills-Novoa, Johannessen, & Collins, 2001). Though by no means a solution, media like this are low cost and, if developed in a manner that appeals to students, may help mitigate risk on campus. While prevention efforts geared toward college entry are important, given the diverse concerns that young adults transitioning out of high school face, intervention programs designed for high school students during their final semester should be considered, given the numerous opportunities this population has for risky behaviors. Such a program may help reduce risk of increased engagement during the transitional period. While many universities offer programs for incoming freshmen, programs targeting students while they are still in high school and during their transition to college may be a more effective approach (Fromme et al., 2008). Applying the aforementioned prevention strategies at school assemblies or requiring small group format infor- mation sessions on blackouts and SRT may be a way to help educate transitional youth.
