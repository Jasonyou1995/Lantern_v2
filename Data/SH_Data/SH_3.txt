Sociosexuality as predictor of sexual harassment and coercion in femaleand male highschool students




Abstract
Sexual harassment and coercion have mainly been considered from a sex difference perspective. While traditional social science theories
have explained harassment as male dominance of females, the evolutionary perspective has suggested that sex differences in the desire for sex
are a better explanation. This study attempts to address individual differences associated with harassment from an evolutionary perspective.
Considering previous research that has found links between sociosexual orientation inventory (SOI) and harassment, we consider whether
this association can be replicated in a large, representative sample of high school students (N=1199) from a highly egalitarian culture.
Expanding the previous studies which mainly focused on male perpetrators and female victims, we also examine females and males as both
perpetrators and as victims. We believe that unrestricted sociosexuality motivates people to test whether others are interested in short-term
sexual relations in ways that sometimes might be defined as harassment. Furthermore, unrestricted individuals signal their sociosexual
orientation, and while they do not desire all individuals that react to these signals with sexual advances, they attract much more sexual
advances than individuals with restricted sociosexual orientations, especially from other unrestricted members of the opposite sex. This more
or less unconscious signaling thus makes them exploitable, i.e., harassable. We find that SOI is a predictor for sexual harassment and
coercion among high school students. The paper concludes that, as expected, unrestricted sociosexuality predicts being both a perpetrator and
a victim of both same-sex and opposite-sex harassment.

1. Introduction
Sexual harassment at work represents a considerable
problem in the management of organizations (UN, 2006).
Early studies portrayed the traditional view of male
perpetrators and adverse consequences for female victims
(Fitzgerald, 1993). The feminist perspective has focused on
men's need for power as the root cause of conflict between the
sexes, seeing sexual harassment as a tool of patriarchy
(Browne, 2006; Studd, 1996). Sexual harassment is linked to
the need to dominate women accompanied by hostile
attitudes (including condoning forced sex) and men's use of
their organizational power to oppress their female subordinates
(Smith & Konik, 2011; Tangri, Burt, & Johnson,
1982). Evolutionary psychology (EP) presents an alternative
perspective claiming that sex is the driving force in sexual
harassment—not males' need for power over women (Buss,
1996; Vandermassen, 2011). We support Vandermassen's
(2011) perspective that feminism and EP may mutually
inform each other, but one needs to treat both approaches as
testable scientific theories (Buss & Schmitt, 2011). As such,
the contemporary discussion in the journal Sex Roles (Smith
& Konik, 2011) may reflect a watershed in the debate
between these two perspectives, resulting in less polemic and
more empirical testing (although see Liesen, 2011).
Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexually
oriented behavior such as offensive sexual attention or
hostile behaviors that focus on gender (Fitzgerald, Collinsworth,
& Harned, 2001; Studd, 1996). It is worth noting that
“unwanted” and “offensive” are from the perspective of the

person experiencing the harassment. Similar acts from more
attractive persons might not be considered harassment, but
rather be perceived as flirtatious (Browne, 2006). Sexual
harassment covers various acts ranging from sexual
comments (obscene language and jokes) and spreading
rumors, through inappropriate sexual advances to showing
pictures of nudity and sex. Sexual coercion is the use of
physical force to obtain sex.
Most research on sexual harassment, conducted within
the hierarchical organizational context, has studied adult
male perpetrators and female targets. However, sexual
harassment is common among high school girls and also
among boys (American Association of University Women,
2001; Bendixen & Kennair, 2008; Witkowska, 2005).
Studies report 12-month prevalence rates in the 40%–50%
range for sexist jokes, degrading and obscene sexual
comments, and homophobic insults. Nearly one in four
high school students reported the spreading of sexual
rumors, being shown pictures of nudity, and being asked
for sexual favors. Apart from homophobic insults, more girls
than boys reported harassment. Coercion is much less
common but is still reported by a significant proportion of
students (Bendixen & Kennair, 2008).
Several findings support the sexual motives hypothesis
advanced by EP (Studd, 1996). The evidence is particularly
strong that victims of sexual harassment are not random
women. They are disproportionally young, single, and
employed as low-level office workers, waitresses, or cooks
in the service sector (Browne, 2006; Studd, 1996). From a
male perspective, gaining sexual access to a young and
single woman would, potentially, bring greater reproductive
benefits than sexual access to an older married woman.
Reliable patterns of sexual harassment and coercion may
be predicted by EP (Buss & Kenrick, 1998). Over
evolutionary time, the use of coercive means to gain sexual
access to unconsenting women increased the reproductive
fitness for males but not for females. Differences in evolved
sexual strategies (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Trivers, 1972) and
evolved mental mechanisms between the sexes explain why
women perceive more situations as sexual harassment or
why more men are perpetrators of sexual harassment (Studd
& Gattiker, 1991), why more males overperceive sexual
intent from the opposite sex (Haselton, 2003), or why the
same behavior by different men is perceived differently by
women (Sheets & Braver, 1999).
Evolved sex differences have been far more subject to
investigation than individual differences, while there are
greater behavioral differences within the same sex than
between the sexes (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). Currently,
there is growing interest in evolved individual
differences and explanations of within-sex differences
(Buss & Hawley, 2010).
This paper addresses whether there are evolved withinsex
differences that predict sexual harassment and coercion
of others and predictors of being harassed or coerced. Early
findings (Bendixen & Kennair, 2008) suggest that there is a
large overlap between those who harass others and those
who are targets of harassment. The etiology of this is not
understood, and it remains open to question whether
harassing others increases the risk of being harassed (or
vice versa) or whether harassing others and being a target of
harassment share common individually differing antecedents.
Who is harassed, and how are they identified as
exploitable by harassers?
Buss and Duntley (2008) suggest that there are different
types of exploitation—and there will be different markers
that suggest whether or not one is prone to being exploited in
a specific area. Such areas of vulnerability are, therefore,
person and context specific. Evolved mental mechanisms
will be specifically orientated toward perceiving such signs
of exploitability. For example, Sakaguchi and Hasegawa
(2006) found that Japanese males used awkward gait as a cue
to vulnerability for inappropriate touching. Moreover, the
male subjects' judgments were able to predict real-life sexual
harassment, as reported by the female walkers. Exploitability
is thus a specific quality of an individual that conveys to
potential exploiters the following information (Buss &
Duntley, 2008).
Sakaguchi and Hasegawa (2007) found that unexpected
sexual attention was predicted by the targets' unrestricted
sociosexuality as measured by Simpson and Gangestad's
(1991) sociosexual orientation inventory (SOI; a stable
individual behavioral and attitudinal characteristic that
predicts sexual behavior across many different situations).
Inappropriate touching of body parts was, however, not
predicted by SOI. Hence, high-SOI persons are more
subject to harassment, but not necessarily to coercion in
this study.
Individual differences in SOI are discernible to observers:
SOI may be estimated through visual cues such as facial
features and body language (Boothroyd, Jones, Burt,
DeBruine, & Perrett, 2008; Gangestad, Simpson, DiGeronimo,
& Biek, 1992; Sakaguchi & Hasegawa, 2007), and
high-SOI females are rated to be more attractive than lowSOI
females. In the light of Sexual Strategies Theory (Buss
& Schmitt, 1993), the major sex difference in SOI (Schmitt,
2005) is due to males being more open to short-term relations
(Clark & Hatfield, 1989; Kennair, Schmitt, Fjeldavli, &
Harlem, 2009), while females consider sexual relations more
from a long-term perspective (Campbell, 2008; Haselton &
Buss, 2001; Surbey & Conohan, 2000).
Individuals with high SOI scores thus seem to signal their
greater interest in short-term sexual affairs. These signals are
perceived by others (Sakaguchi & Hasegawa, 2007).
Compared to individuals with a restricted sociosexuality,
they will, therefore, attract more sexual attention—not least
from other unrestricted individuals of the opposite sex.
If we compared two females—one with an unrestricted
sociosexuality and one with lower SOI scores—in a
social setting, we might find the following: unrestricted
sociosexuality elicits much more sexual solicitations. If the
numbers of solicitations were similar, the female with the
480 L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479–490
lower SOI scores would find more of these harassing, as
fewer of the attempts to interest her in having casual sex
would be desirable. But the total number of advances is
expected to be significantly higher due to the female with
higher SOI scores signaling availability, and not all of these
are welcome; unrestricted females will not find all males
attractive. This may add up to a higher total number of
experienced harassing advances. In addition, intrasexual
competition would put high-SOI subjects at a higher risk of
being subject to insults, slander, rumors, and other forms of
derogation (Schmitt & Buss, 1996). High-SOI subjects are
expected to report more sexual harassment because they are
the object of both unwanted sexual advances from members
of the opposite sex as well as derogation from same-sex
competitors. We suggest that the perpetrators might perceive
their victim's unrestricted sociosexuality as a cue to
exploitability; high-SOI subjects will signal harassability.
High-SOI individuals are probably not aware of the effects of
advertising their unrestricted sociosexuality to both desirable
and undesirable potential sexual partners. It is the increased
amount of undesirable partners that increases the high-SOI
individuals' experience of harassability. While experiencing
more harassment, signaling high SOI also increases the
number of desirable sexual encounters.
Haselton (2003) found that unrestricted sociosexuality
was positively associated with the total number of misperceptions
of sexual intention. Misperception and biased
communication between the sexes might increase the level of
perceived sexual harassment in society. Yost and Zurbriggen
(2006) found that SOI predicted coercion. In their limited
sample of adults, they also noted that females with high SOI
scores had more fantasies about sexually dominating others.
We posit that behavior described as sexual harassment is
primarily behavior that intends to investigate whether the
initial perception of an unrestricted sociosexuality is correct,
and whether “hooking up” or other short-term sexual
relations are possible. Thus, sexually laden communication
that signals interest in physical aspects of sex and sexual
surgency, rather than love and commitment, is the hallmark
of these interactions. Individuals with a restricted sociosexuality
will receive much less undesirable attention—due
to not advertising an interest in casual sex and signaling
exploitability (behavior that increases the number of
undesired sexual advances) to the same degree.
If the intention is to dominate or suppress, a perpetrator of
sexual harassment ought to target individuals with restricted
sociosexuality—as those individuals would be most upset by
the behavior. We believe that the main intention is to solicit
sex, and thus targeting individuals that advertise their
unrestricted sociosexuality is the most effective strategy.
Consequently, higher SOI scores will predict an increased
likelihood of being harassed, despite a greater interest in
receiving sexual attention from attractive partners. Furthermore,
sexually aggressive and harassing behavior, understood
as attempts to procure casual sex rather than a romantic
relationship, is also predicted by increased SOI scores.
In this study, the association between SOI and sexual
harassment and coercion is examined using a large sample of
gender egalitarian high school students in the context of
more traditional social science variables. Exposure to
pornography, coercive sexual attitudes, and sexist attitudes
are all consistently found to correlate with self-reported
coercion (Begany & Milburn, 2002; Glick & Fiske, 1996;
Malamuth, Addison, & Koss, 2000; Yost & Zurbriggen,
2006). For this reason, measures of porn exposure (type and
frequency) as well as attitudes toward coercion (rape myths)
and blatant, hostile sexism are included in our analysis. In
addition, the analyses are extended to measures of being
sexually harassed and coerced, as the prior literature on this
particular issue is scarce.
1.1. Predictions
1. Based on Sakaguchi and Hasegawa's (2007) findings,
we would expect that sociosexuality, as measured by
SOI, is positively associated with self-reports of being
sexually harassed among female respondents. Despite
Sakaguchi & Hasegawa's finding that unrestricted
sociosexuality did not predict touching, we expect
theoretically that unrestricted females will signal their
sociosexuality in such a manner that will also attract
more coercion.
2. Based on Yost and Zurbriggen's (2006) findings, we
would expect that sociosexuality is positively associated
with perpetration of sexual harassment and
coercion among male respondents.
3. We expect that the effect of SOI outlasts competing
variables such as exposure to pornography, coercive
sexual attitudes (rape myths), and sexism.
Studies on female sexual harassers and coercers are
scarce. This also holds true for male targets of these
behaviors. We included female perpetrators as well as male
targets, which enabled us to study how sociosexuality relates
to both sexual harassment and coercion in male and female
respondents as perpetrators and victims. The expectation of
this exploratory perspective is that SOI also predicts male
victims and female perpetrators. Our design also allows for
the examination of SOI as a predictor of same-sex and
opposite-sex sexual harassment.
The competing social science predictions would suggest
that if male dominance is the primary motivation for
harassment, there should be very limited female harassment
of males and same-sex harassment. In addition, competing
predictions would suggest that other social factors such as
coercive and sexist attitudes and porn exposure would
outweigh the importance of SOI. The third alternative is
Malamuth's (1996) confluence model, where both hostile
masculinity and sexual promiscuity predict male coercion.
This model combines feminist and evolutionary positions.

2. Method
2.1. Design and subjects
A cross-sectional study covering students enrolled in nine
high schools was carried out in Central Norway. In total,
1610 (49.3% of 3260 eligible for study) students responded
to a web-based questionnaire. Ages ranged between 16 and
26 (modal age 17 years). An age-homogeneous sample was
created including only those aged 16 to 18 years (95% of the
sample). Approximately 5% of the students were selfnominated
non-Norwegians. Parents' level of education and
employment status were used as indicators of socioeconomic
status (SES). Half of the students reported that their parents
had college or university education, and 85% reported both
parents being employed. The final sample of 1199 students
covered clearly trustworthy, consistent, valid, and selfnominated
heterosexual respondents.
2.2. Procedure
The web-survey was carried out during November 2007.
Parents and school staff received written information about
the study, stating the purpose and content of the project.
Written informed consent was collected from students and
parents. Classroom arrangements ensured anonymity and
confidentiality. The questionnaire and the procedure were
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee and by the
Norwegian Social Science Data Service.
2.3. Measurements
2.3.1. Independent variables
2.3.1.1. Sociosexual orientation inventory. The study
included three of the original five components described in
Simpson and Gangestad (1991)1
: (1) number of different
partners in the past year; (2) number of different one-night
stands ever; and (3) attitudes toward engaging in casual,
uncommitted sex (three items). The scores were aggregated
to indexes according to Simpson and Gangestad (1991).
Each component's scores were standardized for each sex
before totaling. Due to highly skewed distributions for the
components measuring number of past partners, these scores
were log-transformed before standardization. The components
showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=.71
and α=.72 for males and females, respectively). We
aggregated the SOI scores into separate SOI-Behavior and
SOI-Attitudes scales (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; Webster &
Bryan, 2007).
2.3.1.2. Exposure to pornography (porn exposure). The
subjects responded to three questions regarding whether
they used erotica and pornography during the past year,
including erotic magazines, X-rated movies or magazines,
and triple-X-rated movies or magazines, and one on the
frequency of use. Fifty-four percent of males and 2% of
females reported weekly or more frequent use of erotica and
porn. The four items were standardized before being
aggregated to form the index “Porn Exposure.” Internal
consistency for the index was acceptable (α=.66 and α=.72
for males and females, respectively).
2.3.1.3. Coercive (sexual) attitudes. We developed a nineitem
instrument that measured beliefs and attitudes toward
forced sex based on Lonsway and Fitzgerald's (1995) 19-
item “Rape Myth Scale.” As this phenomenon is not
restricted to female victimization, the items were revised to
incorporate an equal number of items covering acts carried
out toward males and females. The wording was changed to
ease responding in younger populations. Five-point Likert
scaling was used. Internal consistency was excellent (α=.86
for males and α=.88 for females). High scores on this index
reflect denial of the negative consequences of being forced to
have sex, attributing responsibility to victims of sexual
exploitation, and mistrusting the motives for reporting the
offence to the police.
2.3.1.4. Classical sexism. We used Ekehammar, Akrami,
and Araya's (2000) seven-item instrument on classical
sexism developed for and validated on Scandinavian
samples. Five-point Likert scaling was applied. Internal
consistency was good (α=.78 for males and α=.74 for
females). High scores reflect approval of sex division of
labor, and blatant negative beliefs about women's logical
reasoning and skills.
2.3.1.5. SES. A four-point scale measured students'
parent's highest level of education (separate items for
mother and father). In addition, parent's work status
(“none working,” “mother only working,” “father only
working,” “both working”) was reported. The items were
standardized before aggregation.
2.3.2. Outcome variables: sexual harassment and coercion
The index for measuring sexual harassment and aggression
was partly based on the work of Witkowska and
Kjellberg (2005) that was developed for use in Scandinavian
teenage populations. This work built upon Fitzgerald,
Gelfand, and Drasgow (1995) and covered the basic
dimensions of unwanted sexual behavior including indirect
nonverbal forms of sexual harassment but excluding
coercion. In the present nine-item instrument, we added
two items on “digital” harassment (“having received phone
calls, cell phone text messages, cell phone multimedia
messages or e-mail or chat with explicit sexual content” and
“someone distributed pictures of you with sexual content on
1 Due to sample characteristics, the items “Number of foreseen sexual
partners” and “Frequency of sexual fantasy with other than your current
partner” were omitted. Thirty-six percent of females and 46% of males
reported not having had first intercourse, and 67% of females and 79% of
males reported not “going steady.” The two items were omitted due to
questionable relevance.
482 L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479–490
the internet or through cell phones”) to the indirect
dimension. Coercion included four items on the use of
explicit physical force (sexual squeezing, touching of
genitals, kissing, and intercourse/oral sex). To ease responding,
we reduced the number of response alternatives to
“never,” “once,” or “twice or more.” The inventory first
addressed being subject to various forms of sexually
unwanted behavior with the following instruction: “Below
you'll find some questions regarding your experiences with
unwanted sexual attention and harassment from others.
Please report only those acts that were offensive, unpleasant
or that you clearly felt were unwanted.” The intention was to
avoid overreporting of insignificant and approved sexual
attention. The social context was not restricted to the school
environment. In five of the items, subjects were asked to
indicate who performed the behavior and in which social
context the behavior took place (at school and/or outside
school). This enabled us to examine separately the correlates
of being targeted by same-sex or opposite-sex peers for a
subsample of harassing/coercive items. In the subsequent
section of the questionnaire, the subjects were asked
equivalent questions about their sexual harassment and
coercion of others.
The 13 items on being sexually harassed and coerced
were dichotomized (Yes/No) before being aggregated into
two indexes. Internal consistency was acceptable for the
nine-item Sexually Harassed Scale (α=.73 for males and
α=.76 for females) but low for the four-item Sexually
Coerced Scale (α=.48 for males and α=.63 for females). The
Sexually Coerced Scale was dichotomized into No/Yes
scores for analysis.
The 13 items measuring sexually harassing and coercing
others were dichotomized (Yes/No) before being aggregated
into their respective indexes. Internal consistency was
acceptable for the nine-item Sexually Harassing Scale
(α=.76 for males and α=.70 for females) but low for the
Sexually Coercive Scale (α=.48 for males and α=.40 for
females). The Sexually Coercive Scale was dichotomized
into No/Yes scores for analysis.
2.4. Analyses
Sex differences were calculated using Cohen's Effect Size
(ES) formulas for continuous variables (d) and proportions
(h). Associations among predictors and between predictors
and outcome variables were measured using Pearson r. We
follow Cohen's (1988) standards for ES values and r.
Sequential regression analysis was performed on Being
Sexually Harassed and on Sexually Harassing Others using
SOI-Behavior and SOI-Attitudes (Block 1), Porn Exposure
(Block 2), and Coercive Sexual Attitudes and Classical
Sexism (Block 3) as predictors. Interaction terms (SOI
components×Porn Exposure, SOI components×Coercive
Attitudes, and SOI components×Classical Sexism) and the
effect of age-cohort were added as predictors in Block 4. The
regressions were regularly checked for standardized residuals,
and outliers outside ±3 S.D. removed. For the two
dichotomous variables on coercion, we adapted direct
logistic regression analyses on the five predictors. Assumptions
were checked throughout (using the Hosmer and
Lemeshow test), and outliers were removed. All analyses
were performed separately for each sex.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptives
Males reported markedly more lenient attitudes toward
unrestricted sex than females (Table 1), which held true
across all attitude items. Small sex differences were evident
for the behavior variables measuring the number of different
sex partners reported in the past year. This was due to a larger
proportion of females (63.4%) than males (47.7%) reporting
having at least one sex partner during the past year. The
average number of different partners in the past year among
those who reported having had sexual partners was slightly
higher for males (M=2.6) than for females (M=2.1). Similar
effects were evident for the variable measuring the number
of different one-night stands. The proportion of one-night
stands was slightly higher for females than for males (45.9%
vs. 40.8%), but the average number of one-night stands was
similar among those who reported one or more one-night
stands (males M=2.2 and females M=2.1).
A much higher proportion of males reported consuming
erotic magazines as well as soft-core and hard-core
pornography. In particular, the frequency of exposure to
erotica and pornographic magazines and movies was
markedly higher for males than for females (d=1.79). Male
respondents also reported more lenient attitudes toward
coercive sex (M=2.61) compared to female respondents
(M=2.08), producing a moderately high effect size.
Females reported being slightly more sexually harassed
than males, and far more females than males reported being
coerced (42% of females vs. 26% of males) (Table 1). The
effect sizes for these sex differences were small to moderate.
A moderate sex effect was found for harassing and coercing
others as male respondents reported stronger involvement in
both harassing others and the use of coercion (10% of males,
3% of females).
3.2. Correlations
The two SOI components were significantly associated
with Porn Exposure for both sexes (r's ranging from .11 to
.25). The SOI components were insignificantly associated
with Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism in females. In
males, the behavioral component of SOI was marginally
associated with Coercive Attitudes (r=.08), but both SOI
components were significantly associated with Classical
Sexism. Furthermore, Porn Exposure was not significantly
associated with Coercive Attitudes in either sex and only
weakly associated with Classical Sexism in males (r=.09).
L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479–490 483
Coercive Attitudes and Sexism were moderately associated
in males and females (r=.30). The outcome variables Being
Harassed and Harassing Others were moderately associated
with the SOI components and Porn Exposure in females and
males. The corresponding associations with Coercive
Attitudes and Classical Sexism were nonsignificant in
females, and between r=.09 and r=.23 in males (Table 2).
Being coerced was moderately associated with the SOI
components and Porn Exposure in females. These associations
were significant but weaker in males. However, both
Coercive Attitudes and Sexism correlated significantly with
being coerced in males. Being coercive was insignificantly
associated with the SOI components, Porn Exposure, and
Sexism in females and only weakly associated with Coercive

Attitudes. Corresponding associations for males were
generally weak but significant (nonsignificant only for
SOI-Behavior). The two components of SOI were moderately
associated, but the disattenuated correlations (assuming
no measurement errors) were strong (.56 for females and .47
for males). Despite the lower number of scale items, these
associations were highly comparable to those reported by
Webster and Bryan (2007) for latent constructs. Finally, we
found that being harassed was substantially associated with
harassing others in the male and female samples (r's above
.60). This finding indicates that there was a large overlap
between targets and perpetrators of sexual harassment in
these samples. Although the correlations were lower, this
also held for dichotomously coded sexual coercion scales.
Adding to the complexity of this phenomenon, males and
females who reported being exposed to high levels of sexual
harassment also tended to report being coerced (r=.54 for
females and r=.42 for males). Neither the student's SES nor
their age cohort showed any association with the sexual
harassment or coercion scales, although the latter correlated
weakly with the SOI components.
3.3. Predictors of being sexually harassed
A hierarchical multiple regression was performed between
being sexually harassed and SOI-Behavior and SOI-Attitudes
in Block 1 (Model 1), Porn Exposure in Block 2 (Model 2),
and Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism in Block 3
(Model 3). This allowed for the study of mediator effects and
direct tests of Prediction 3. Interaction effects and the effect of
age-cohort over and beyond that of the SOI components were
entered in Block 4. Table 3 displays the unstandardized
regression coefficients (B), standard error of the B, standardized
regression coefficients (β), the corresponding t values,
and the level of significance for each predictor at each step of
the analysis. Having an unrestricted sociosexual orientation
markedly increased the risk of being harassed in females. The
effect was stronger for the behavioral component of the SOI
than for the attitudinal component. As can be seen from Table
3, the SOI components remained significant even after
controlling for the contribution of the other variables (but the
effect of SOI-Attitudes was only marginally significant in
Model 2 and Model 3, pb.10). As seen in the lower panel of
Table 3, the two SOI components accounted for fully 11.2%
of the variance in being harassed in Model 1 (adjusted R2 was
10.9%). Porn Exposure significantly predicted being harassed,
adding 5.2% to the explained variance over and above
that of SOI. Porn Exposure also mediated some of the effect
of SOI-Attitudes. As would be expected from the zero-order
correlations, Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism did not
contribute to the prediction. None of the interactions
significantly predicted being harassed, and age-cohort did
not contribute to the explained variance over and above that
of SOI and Porn Exposure.
Similar to the results in the female sample, males with an
unrestricted sociosexual orientation were more likely to be
sexually harassed (Table 4). Again, the behavioral component
was a far better predictor for being sexually harassed than the
attitudinal component. The two SOI components accounted for
9.3% of the variance in being harassed. Adding Porn Exposure
at Step 2 significantly increased the explained variance, but the
effect of the SOI variables remained significant (SOI-Attitudes
only marginally, pb.10). Entering Coercive Attitudes and
Classical Sexism at Step 3 contributed significantly to the
explained variance of being sexually harassed for males
(1.4%), but only the latter reached significance. None of the
interactions (or age-cohort) contributed to the explained
variance in being sexually harassed.
3.3.1. Predictors of being sexually harassed by same-sex or
opposite-sex peers
Descriptive analysis on the reduced four-item harassed
scale showed that same-sex harassment was more prevalent
than opposite-sex harassment for males. For females,

opposite-sex harassment was more prevalent. This is
consistent with the finding that males reported stronger
involvement in sexual harassment of others (Table 1). The
overlap for being harassed by a male peer as well as by a
female peer was considerable (r=.71 for both sexes). To
study the effect of the four predictors of same-sex and
opposite-sex harassment in male and female respondents, we
carried out four separate multiple regressions (Table 5).
The behavior component of SOI turned out to be a
consistent predictor for same-sex and opposite-sex harassment
in both sexes. This was also true for Porn Exposure.
The attitudes component of SOI was significant only for
opposite-sex harassment in male respondents when the other
predictors were included in the model. Coercive Sexual
Attitudes failed to predict same-sex or opposite-sex
harassment, and Classical Sexism was a marginal predictor
only for opposite-sex harassment in males (pb.10).
3.4. Predictors of sexually harassing others
For female respondents, the attitudinal and behavioral
components of SOI were significantly associated with
harassing others. The effect of the two SOI predictors was
equal, suggesting that higher scores on SOI-Behavior or
SOI-Attitudes were related to stronger involvement in
harassing others. The SOI components accounted for 4.3%
of the variance in the outcome variable. Porn Exposure was
positively associated with harassing others and added 6.4%
to the explained variance. Porn Exposure mediated some of
the effects of the SOI components, but SOI still predicted
harassing others in the final model. Coercive Attitudes and
Classical Sexism was not related to the outcome variable
(Model 3). None of the interactions turned out to be
significantly related to harassment (or age-cohort) and hence
are not reported here (Table 6).
Similar to the female sample, males' scores on the SOI
components predicted sexual harassment of others, explaining
9.6% of the variance. As can be seen in Table 7, Porn
Exposure added 4.3% to the explained variance. Adding
Porn Exposure to the equation did, however, not influence
the effect of the two SOI components. Throughout the
three models, SOI-Attitudes was the stronger predictor of
the two SOI components. Adding Coercive Attitudes and
Classical Sexism in Block 3 gave a significant increase
in the explained variance (3.3%) over and above that of
SOI and Porn Exposure, but the effect of the prior
predictors remained unaffected. None of the interactions
or age cohort was significantly associated with harassing
others in male respondents.
3.5. Predictors of being coerced
A direct logistic regression analysis was performed on
being coerced (no/yes) as outcome and the two SOI
components, Porn Exposure, Coercive Attitudes, and
Classical Sexism as predictors. Through a simple Wald

test, an evaluation of individual predictors' contribution to a
model is made available. The test is considered conservative
(increased type II error) (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). The
logistic regression for female respondents (n=557) showed
that high scores on SOI-Behavior, but not SOI-Attitudes,
significantly increased the odds of being coerced by 70%
(Wald [χ2
]=22.11, df=1, pb.001, OR=1.7). Porn Exposure
increased the risk of being coerced by 1.6 (Wald=14.03,
df=1, pb.001). Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism did
not predict being coerced in female respondents. The effect
of interactions and age-cohort was nonsignificant. The
predictors accounted for 12.3% (Nagelkerke R2
) of the
variance in being coerced, correctly identifying 42.8% of the
observed coerced cases.
For male respondents (n=527), the odds of being coerced
was marginally significantly associated with Porn Exposure
(Wald=3.34, df=1, pb.10, OR=1.3). The SOI components
did not predict being coerced, nor did Coercive Attitudes.
The best predictor for being coerced was Classical Sexism
(Wald=6.82, df=1, pb.01, OR=1.6)—none of the interactions
(nor age-cohort) were significantly associated to being
coerced. The predictors accounted for only 5.7% of the
variance, correctly identifying only 4 of the 134 cases of men
that reported being coerced.
3.5.1. Predictors of being coerced by same-sex or
opposite-sex peers (one item)
Female respondents reported being sexually squeezed far
more by male peers than by female peers (18.6% and 2%,
respectively). The corresponding figures for males were
5.6% (same-sex peer) and 7.3% (opposite-sex peer).
Evidently, not only males are involved in this form of
coercion, but coercion is essentially a male toward female
phenomenon. For this reason, the analysis discussed below is
restricted to females (n=555) reporting on unwanted sexual
squeezing from male peers. None of the other logistic
regression analyses (female on female, male on male, female
on male) produced any meaningful or reliable results. The

results closely mirrored those reported above for females
being coerced. While SOI-Behavior significantly increased
the odds of being coerced by a man by 1.4 (Wald=6.06, df=1,
pb.05), SOI-Attitudes was not related to the odds of being
coerced by a man over and above the other predictors. Porn
Exposure marginally increased the odds of being coerced
(Wald=2.99, df=1, pb.10, OR=1.3), while Coercive Attitudes
and Classical Sexism failed to predict being coerced by
a man. The overall explained variance accounted for by the
predictors was low, only 4.1%.
3.6. Predictors of coercing others (males only)
Since only 3% of the female sample reported being
physically coercive, meaningful predictions could only be
performed for males. Applying a hierarchic logistic regression
analysis to prediction of being coercive (regardless of
sex of target) showed that neither of the two SOI components
predicted coercion in male respondents. Only Porn Exposure
(Wald=4.38, df=1, pb.05, OR=1.7) and Coercive Attitudes
predicted coercion (Wald=4.31, df=1, pb.05, OR=1.6). None
of the interactions were significant. Overall, the predictors
accounted for merely 6.4% of the variance in being
physically coercive, but none of the 54 observed cases of
coercion were correctly identified.
4. Discussion
In summary, SOI (especially the behavioral component)
proved to be consistently associated with being sexually
harassed in female respondents, in strong support of our
first prediction. In addition, the behavioral component of
SOI significantly predicted same-sex and opposite-sex
harassment. Expanding earlier findings (Sakaguchi &
Hasegawa, 2007), SOI (behavior) was found to be
consistently associated in both harassed and harassing
female respondents. SOI (behavior) and Porn Exposure
predicted being coerced in females. Any other finding
would challenge our idea that unrestricted sociosexuality is
signaled and thus attracts those seeking short-term sexual
relations. Our second prediction was partly supported, as
SOI consistently predicted male sexual harassment. However,
SOI did not predict coercive behavior in men. In
support of our third prediction, the effect of SOI remained a
significant predictor of sexual harassment when the effect of
porn exposure, coercive attitudes, and classical sexism was
accounted for. This suggests, as we predicted, that
harassment is due to sexual motivation rather than power.
This is further sustained through the bivariate associations
among the predictors. SOI was moderately associated with
the use of pornography (suggesting sexual interest or
desire), while Coercive Attitudes—reflecting the acceptance
of physical force to obtain sexual access—and Classical
Sexism were consistently not associated with either SOI or
the use of pornography.
Our exploratory analyses regarding female perpetrators
of sexual harassment evince similar patterns as in males,
underscoring the importance of SOI as a consistent
predictor for sexual harassment. Too few females reported
coercion to perform any meaningful analyses. Similarly to
females being sexually harassed, SOI consistently predicted
being harassed in males. This was particularly
evident for opposite-sex harassment and also for same-sex
harassment (SOI-Behavior). SOI did not predict being
coerced in males.
It would seem, therefore, as predicted, that unrestricted
sociosexuality increases exploitability for sexual
harassment among males and females. Furthermore, an
interest in sex, but with less interest in emotional
relations and commitment, increases the likelihood of
harassing others.
The competing prediction suggesting that male dominance
over females is the primary motivation for harassment
was largely unsupported in this study. Not only was female
harassment of males quite prevalent, so too was same-sex
peer harassment. In addition, other competing social factors
did not outweigh the importance of sociosexual orientation
in explaining variations in sexual harassment for either of the
sexes. The finding that does not fit the general pattern is that
SOI did not predict coercive behavior in males when
controlling for porn exposure, coercive attitudes, and sexism.
Our findings lend some support to Malamuth's (1996)
confluence model for coercive behavior, but not harassment.
One of the intriguing findings from our study was that the
vast majority of male and female harassers also reported
being harassed. Seeing the particularly strong overlap
between harassing others and being harassed in relation to
the fact that unrestricted sociosexuality significantly contributed
to variations in both being harassed and harassing,
one could speculate that SOI is one of several possible
common factors for perpetrators as well as for victims of
sexual harassment. When we tested this contention by
partialling out the effect of SOI on the association between
harassing others and being harassed, we found that SOI
accounted for only a fraction of the common variance shared
by these two variables.
The main idea behind our predictions was the
hypothesis that harassment is an unrestricted sociosexual
style of behavior, aimed at testing out whether a potential
sexual partner is available for a short-term sexual
encounter, and that perceived harassment behavior to a
large degree is motivated by a desire for sex. However,
many instances of harassment in our study were cases of
same-sex harassment. This may be understood from a
similar perspective. It is an example of sexual surgency or
dominance, and sexual competitiveness (Campbell, 2004).
Thus, the logic of the evolved psychology of derogation
(Schmitt & Buss, 1996) is relevant for understanding this
behavior. Same-sex harassment (mainly derogation) may
be understood as competition for the sexual interest of
onlookers with similar unrestricted sociosexuality, who
488 L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479–490
find these persons sexually attractive because of their
flaunted sexual surgency.
This study considered responses from both sexes on
questions regarding harassing others and being harassed. In
addition, the variety of actions covered by this study
allows for an analysis of both sexual harassment and
coercion. The present results from a younger sample, a
much more homogenous, gender egalitarian culture, in a
nonworkplace setting, provide a novel testing ground for
less established power relations and sex roles than previous
investigations—and cannot merely be dismissed due to
lack of gender equality (e.g., Eagly & Wood, 1999). Notably,
harassment was rather frequent in this more egalitarian
setting. The results replicate previous findings (Malamuth,
Sockloskie, Koss, & Tanaka, 1991; Sakaguchi & Hasegawa,
2007; Yost & Zurbriggen, 2006) and also expand these
findings to include female harassers and male victims, as well
as suggest that sexual interest is the major driving force
behind harassment.
4.1. Limitations and future research
Despite having a large and comprehensive data set of
high school students, we need to restrict our current
inferences to young people in sexually liberal and gender
egalitarian societies with a high degree of porn exposure and
availability. In addition, our study was cross-sectional,
and in order to examine the etiology of sexual harassment
and coercion, one needs to apply panel designs following the
same students over time—as only a prospective, longitudinal
design may address causality. Finally, our measure of
attitudes toward coercion was based on prior measures of
rape myths, which may have been too restricted for our
purpose as the main attitude object was rape. As coercion
involves numerous acts of physical force—rape being one
extreme act—an attitudinal measure covering a broader set
of forced sex may have produced partly different results. On
the other hand, and unlike prior use of measurements for
rape myths, our measure was not restricted to attitudes
toward females.
4.2. Conclusion
While more boys sexually harass and coerce than girls,
both sexes commit sexual harassment and coercive acts. And
while many different negative precursors and correlates have
been suggested, it would seem that the main motive is an
interest in short-term sex—indicated by an unrestricted
sociosexuality. This same characteristic also causes behavior
that advertises an interest in sex, increasing the attraction of
nonattractive partners. Furthermore, these individuals probably
have an increased interest in sexual competition, thus
both being subject to and partaking in same-sex derogation.
Thus, an unrestricted sociosexual orientation is related to
both harassing behavior and being a victim of harassment in
high school.
