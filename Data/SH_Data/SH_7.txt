A latent class analysis of school climate among middle and high school
students in California public schools




Abstract
Research has shown that a positive school climate plays a protective role in the social, emotional, and academic
development of adolescent youth. Researchers have utilized variable centered measures to assess school climate,
which is limited in capturing heterogeneous patterns of school climate. In addition, few studies have systematically
explored the role of race and gender in perceived school climate. This study utilizes a latent class approach to
assess whether there are discrete classes of school climate in a diverse statewide sample of middle and high
school youth. Drawing from the 2009–2011 California Healthy Kids Survey, this study identified four latent classes
of school climate: Some caring, connectedness, and safe; negative climate; high caring, participation, and safe;
and positive climate. The findings indicated that race and grade level significantly predicted school climate class
membership. Black students were three times more likely to be members of the negative school climate class,
when compared to White students. Gender did not significantly predict school climate class membership. The results
of this study provide school climate researchers and educators with a nuanced picture of school climate patterns
among middle and high school students.

1. Introduction
Researchers and educators for several decades have acknowledged
that a positive school climate plays a contributing role in a wide range
of adolescent outcomes, including academic achievement, mental
health, substance abuse, and school violence (Thapa, Cohen, Guffey, &
Higgins-D'Alessandro, 2013). School climate organizations such as the
National School Climate Center, Center for Academic, Social and Emotional
Learning (CASEL) have recently developed state standards and
school-based programs, interventions, curriculum, and resources for
improving school climate. In addition, in the past two decades, public
schools throughout the United States have incorporated school climate
interventions into educational reform initiatives. Efforts to improve
school climate such as bullying prevention, threat assessment, and
school safety programs have been implemented by K-12 schools in
the United States and in international contexts to foster caring relationships,
safety, and connectedness among youth (Benbenishty & Astor,
2005; Thapa et al., 2013).
Defining and measuring school climate has been a challenge. Researchers
have noted the discrepancies in the literature, regarding
school climate domains and measures (Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, &
Pickeral, 2009; Zullig, Koopman, Patton, & Ubbes, 2010). Scholars have
recently defined school climate as the collective beliefs, values, and attitudes
that prevail at school and have measured the multiple dimensions
of school climate, including caring relationships with adults, safety,
school connectedness, and meaningful participation (Cohen et al.,
2009; Koth, Bradshaw, & Leaf, 2008; Modin & Östberg, 2009; Thapa
et al., 2013; Zullig et al., 2010). However, most research has assessed
school climate using individual scales of school climate in isolation.
Few studies have attempted to uncover the heterogenous patterns of
school climate, as experienced by students (Konold & Cornell, 2015).
In addition, while educational researchers have documented differential
academic achievement and outcomes by race and gender, researchers
have not systematically explored how different groups of students (i.e.
race and gender) experience multiple dimensions of school climate
(Gage, Prykanowski, & Larson, 2014; Thapa et al., 2013). Given this
gap in school climate research, this study utilizes a latent class approach
to explore heterogenous patterns of school climate in a large statewide
sample of middle and high school students. This study also examines
how different groups of students (i.e. race and gender) experience multiple
dimensions of school climate.
1.1. Defining school climate
Recently, a series of school climate studies and literature reviews has
defined school climate as comprised of multiple dimensions (Cohen
et al., 2009; De Pedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, & Esqueda, 2014;

Thapa et al., 2013). These dimensions include caring relationships with
adults, safety, school connectedness, and meaningful participation
(Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; De Pedro et al., 2014). Caring relationships
is defined as a student's perception of the extent of social and emotional
support they receive from teachers and other school adults. Safety is de-
fined as a student's sense of physical and social–emotional security.
School connectedness is defined as the degree to which students feel
they belong to a school community and have a positive connection
with peers and adults in a school community. Meaningful participation
is the involvement of students in relevant, engaging and interesting opportunities
that develop a sense of responsibility in the school community
(Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; De Pedro et al., 2014). Recent studies
have utilized these domains to assess school climate in different school
contexts (De Pedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, & Berkowitz, 2015; De
Pedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, & Berkowitz, in press; De Pedro
et al., 2014).
A positive and caring social and emotional school climate has been
found to influence a wide array of adolescent outcomes (Cohen et al.,
2009; Thapa et al., 2013). This includes schooling, such as attendance,
motivation, cooperative learning, and test scores; risky behaviors, such
as bullying and victimization, aggression, risky sexual behavior, alcohol,
and drug use; and psychological outcomes, including psychiatric disorders,
depression, anxiety, and well-being. Studies have demonstrated
the protective effect of school climate on youth development in various
geographic locales (Astor, Benbenishty, & Estrada, 2010; Thapa et al.,
2013). For instance, scholars have found that school climate mitigates
the effect of poverty, war and trauma, community violence, and family
stress on schooling, mental health, and social development (Astor
et al., 2010; Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; Marachi, Astor, & Benbenishty,
2006; Thapa et al., 2013).
School climate researchers primarily have utilized a variable centered
approach. This approach aims to examine how different school climate
constructs influence outcomes. The variable centered approach is
limited in capturing heterogenous patterns of school climate, specifically
how different components of school climate coalesce among students
(Gage et al., 2014; Konold & Cornell, 2015). Latent class analysis (LCA) is
an exploratory person centered approach that assumes a categorical latent
factor. The goal of LCA is to group individuals into categories, each
one of which contains individuals who are similar to each other and different
from individuals in other categories (Muthén & Muthén, 2000).
LCA is well suited for one critical aim of this study, which is to uncover
discrete classes of school climate in a large sample of middle and high
school students.
1.2. Race, gender, and school climate
Research exploring the role of race as a factor that influences school
climate perceptions is a growing area of research (Koth et al., 2008;
Thapa et al., 2013). Among elementary students, perceived caring relationships
vary by race. Schneider and Duran (2010) found that Latino
third grade students viewed personal relationships with teachers
more important than adults modeling positive behaviors; this view
was different from White and Asian students. Furthermore, in a study
of 1000 African-American students and 260 Latino third graders in the
Chicago Comer School Development Program, African-American children
perceived teacher-child relations as the most important dimension
of school climate, while Latino students prioritized teacher fairness, caring,
praise of effort, and the importance of moral order above other aspects
of school climate (Slaughter-Defoe & Carlson, 1996).
Only a few studies have examined the role of race in explaining variation
in school climate among middle and high school youth. These
studies have focused on students' perception of racial climate.
Schneider and Duran (2010) found that African-American middle and
high school youth perceive racial climate more negatively than White
peers. Furthermore, a negative racial climate was significantly related
to higher rates of discipline and lower grade among racial minority
students, which in turn, adversely impacted college preparation
(Schneider & Duran, 2010; Thapa et al., 2013). More studies are needed
to explore how different racial groups experience multiple components
of school climate. Given this gap in school climate research, the current
study explores associations between school climate class membership
and race.
School climate studies have not yet examined differences in how
boys and girls experience multiple components of school climate. However,
school violence researchers have identified differences in the frequency
and type of violence experienced by boys and girls at school,
which is known to impact perceptions of safety, a dimension of school
climate (Benbenishty & Astor, 2005). Some research found that boys
are more likely to report frequent victimization than girls while other
research indicated no significant differences between boys and girls
in victimization prevalence (Berkowitz, De Pedro, & Gilreath, 2015).
Disparities in the frequency of male and female students' victimization
may be explained by the type of violence experienced by both genders.
Studies have shown that female students are more likely to experience
relational and indirect victimization while male students are more likely
to experience direct forms of physical victimization (Batsche & Knoff,
1994; Casey-Cannon, Pasch, Tschann, & Flores, 2006; Finkelhor,
Ormrod, & Turner, 2007; Hartung, Little, Allen, & Page, 2011;
Murray-Close, Ostrov, & Crick, 2007; Peskin, Tortolero, & Markham,
2006). In addition, girls experience sexual harassment more frequently
than boys, and boys perpetrate sexual harassment more frequently
than girls (Gruber & Fineran, 2007; McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, &
Craig, 2002; Pepler et al., 2006). These disparities in the experience of
violence and victimization by boys and girls, have led us to hypothesize
that boys and girls may also experience climate differently. Hence, this
study explores gender as a factor influencing school climate class
membership.
1.3. Study objectives
The current study contributes to the emerging need among educational
researchers and school professionals for a deeper understanding
of the complex patterns of school climate among middle and high
school students. Hence, this study utilizes latent class analysis to identify
and classify school climate perceptions in a statewide sample of secondary
public school students in California. This study also assesses how
demographic variables such as race and gender are associated with
school climate.
Latent class analysis is utilized as an exploratory tool to examine a
multi-dimensional construct, school climate, in a novel way. Notwithstanding,
we anticipated that there would be at least three classes of
students based upon the literature—those that did not perceive positive
school climate, those who were mixed in their perceptions, and those
who perceived positive school climate. Based on previous research on
race and school climate, we expected low levels of school climate to
be associated with non-white students.
2. Method
This study employed a cross-sectional design. The data used in this
study are from the 2011–2013 administration of the California Healthy
Kids Survey (CHKS), conducted by the California Department of Education
and WestEd, a nonprofit research, development, and service agency.
The CHKS is the largest statewide survey of elementary, middle, and
high school students' perceptions of school climate, resiliency, and risk
behaviors in the United States (Austin, Bates, & Duerr, 2013). The
CHKS is a biennial survey that is comprised of a required core module
that gathers demographic data (i.e. gender, grade, and race and ethnicity),
school climate perceptions, and health-related behaviors (i.e. alcohol
use, drug use, violence and victimization).

2.1. Participants and consent procedures
As required by the California Department of Education (CDE),
schools must survey a representative districtwide grade-level sample
of students in the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th grades. The sampling procedure
requires that (a) 100% of all district schools participated or 100%
of all selected schools from an approved sampling plan participated;
(b) an appropriate class subject or class period was identified and
used; (c) 100% of selected classrooms participated; (d) the number of
completed, usable answer forms obtained per grade was 60% or more
of the selected sample; or (d) if active parental consent was used, 70%
or more parents within each grade's selected sample returned signed
permission forms, either consenting or not consenting to their child's
participation.
Parental consent was obtained for each participant by each school
district before survey administration through the CDE and WestEd.
The core survey module was administered by school staff members familiar
with survey administration or by West Ed proctors if a school
site chose to hire professionally trained survey administrators.
Proctoring instructions were provided for all survey administrators. All
proctors read an introductory script to all student participants. Proctors
encouraged participants to respond to questions honestly and assured
that their responses would be anonymous. Participants were permitted
to withdraw from the survey at any time. The survey took approximately
50 min to complete.
CHKS data was collected for the 2011–2013 academic school years
from students (n = 577,026). A weighting procedure was used to adjust
the total of grade level respondents to represent the total district enrollment
for the particular grade levels of interest and district level clustering
was also accounted for. District-level consent procedures were
followed, and the present study has appropriate university IRB
approval.
2.2. Measures
This study included demographic variables such as student selfreported
demographic variables (grade level, race and ethnicity, and
gender). Grade level was represented by seventh grade as the reference
category and two dummy variables—ninth grade and 11th grade. Race
and ethnicity was represented by White as the reference category, and
the dummy variables were Black, Asian/NH/PI, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity,
and multiple races.
2.2.1. School climate measures
As seen in Table 1, multiple school climate variables from the CHKS
were included in this study. The following domains and items of school
climate were utilized in recent studies to assess school climate: safety,
caring relationships, school connectedness, and meaningful participation.
Past research utilizing these items have shown these scales to
have high reliability and construct validity (De Pedro et al., 2015, in
press).
2.2.1.1. Safety. One item asked respondents about their perceptions of
safety in their schools. The item is “How safe do you feel when you are
at school?” The responses to this item were 1 = very safe, 2 = safe,
3 = neither safe nor unsafe, 4 = unsafe, and 5 = very unsafe.
2.2.1.2. Caring relationships. The caring relationships scale was comprised
of six items: At my school, there is a teacher or some other
adult who tells me I do a good job; who tells me when I do good; who
notices when I'm not there; who always wants me to do my best;
who listens to me when I have something to say; who believes I will
be a success. The responses to these items were on a four-point Likert
scale and ranged from 1 = not at all true, 2 = a little true, 3 = pretty
much true, and 4 = very much true.
2.2.1.3. School connectedness. The school connectedness scale was comprised
of three items: Strongly agree or disagree with, I feel close to people
at this school; I am happy to be at this school; I feel like I am part of
this school; The teachers at this school treat students fairly; I feel safe in
my school. The possible responses to these items were on a five-point
Likert scale and ranged from 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree,
3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.
2.2.1.4. Meaningful participation. The meaningful participation scale was
comprised of three items: I do interesting activities at school; At school, I
help decide things like class activities; and, I do things that make a difference.
The possible responses to these items were on a four-point
Likert scale and ranged 1 = not at all true, 2 = a little true, 3 = pretty
much true, and 4 = very much true. The composite score of each participant
was derived by summing up the three items and dividing by 3.

2.3. Analytic approach
LCA was conducted using Mplus 7.3 (Lubke & Muthén, 2007). LCA is
used to identify homogeneous subgroups, which share a common pattern
of responses within a heterogeneous population (Lanza, Collins,
Lemmon, & Schafer, 2007; Magidson & Vermunt, 2002). Multinomial logistic
regression analyses were completed simultaneously with class estimation
to account for measurement error related to class assignment.
Gender, race/ethnicity and grade level were included as demographic
covariates in that regression.
A series of models was run to determine the appropriate number of
classes for school climate. We started with a 1-class model followed by
a series of models with specifying increased number of classes (e.g. 2-
class and 3-class), each representing different patterns of school climate.
Optimal model selection was based upon recommended indices including
low Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) relative to other
models, significant Lo–Mendell–Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR LRT),
and acceptable quality of classification (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthén,
2007). Once the appropriate number of classes was identified, a final
model including the demographic variables as predictors of class membership
was run.
3. Results
3.1. Sample characteristics
The sample was 49% male. 34.3% of the students were in 7th, 34.5%
were in 9th grade, and 31.2% were in the 11th grade (see Table 2). Latino
students comprised 51.1% of the sample, followed by Whites (22.6%),
Asians (10.8%), Multiracial (12.0%), and African American (3.6%).
3.2. Description of the latent classes
As shown in Table 3, a four class model provided the best overall fit
to the data for school climate. The four class solution was based on a significant
Lo–Mendel–Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR-LRT). The five
class solution was not significant indicating the four class solution fits
the data better. In addition, the BIC for the four class solution was
5,256,005.504, and the BIC solution for the five class solution was
6,039,094.710. The four class solution had the lowest absolute value, indicating
that this solution fit the data better. Finally, from a substantive
standpoint, the additional class obtained in the five class solution was
not practically different from the negative class in the four class
solution.
The four classes were termed: Some caring, connectedness, and safe;
negative climate; high caring, participation, and safe; and positive climate.
This is exemplified by the non-significant p-value for the five
class model which indicates that the (K-1)-class model should not be
rejected in favor of a model with at least K-classes.
Conditional means and probabilities for school climate are summarized
in Table 3. The results showed that 51.1% of all participants were
in the first latent class. The members of this class reported average levels
of caring representing “pretty much true.” This class had neutral (neither
agree nor disagree) perceptions of connectedness and perceived
“a little” meaningful participation. They had over a 50% chance of
reporting that they felt safe or very safe at their school. Approximately
11% of youth were in latent class two. This class on average “disagreed”
with feeling connected to school and perceived “a little” caring relationships
and participation. They had a 25% chance of feeling safe or very
safe in school. Latent class three was comprised of 2.4% of the sample.
The members of this class on average disagreed that they were connected
to school. They perceived “pretty much true” that they had caring relationships
and on average close to perceiving it was “pretty much true”
that meaningful participation existed. They had a 62% chance of
reporting that they felt safe or very safe in school. Finally, 35.2% were
in latent class four. On average youth agreed that they were connected
at school and that it was “pretty much true” that they had caring relationships
and meaningful participation in their school. The members
of this class had an almost 90% chance of reporting that they felt safe
or very safe in their school.
3.3. Multinomial logistic regression analyses of race, gender, and school
climate
Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that race influenced
school climate class membership (see Table 4). Compared to
Whites, African Americans were almost three times as likely to be members
of the negative climate class (OR = 2.90, 95% CI 2.58–3.25) and
1.65 times as likely to be in the some caring, connectedness, and safe
class (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.53–1.79). African-Americans were also
more than three times as likely to be members of the high caring, participation,
and safe class, when compared to White students (OR = 3.38,
95% CI 2.94–3.89). Compared to Whites, Latino students were twice as
likely to be in the high caring, participation, and safe climate class
(OR = 2.42, 95% CI 2.25–2.61) and twice as likely to be in the some caring,
connectedness, participation, and safe class (OR = 2.00, 95% CI
1.90–2.11). In addition, compared to White students, Asian students
were 1.47 times more likely to be members of the some caring, connectedness,
and safe climate class. As seen in Table 4, multinomial logistic
regression showed no significant associations between gender and
school climate class membership.
Being in a higher grade was associated with membership in negative
school climate, when compared to positive school climate. Ninth
graders were significantly more likely to be members of the low school
climate class (OR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.71–2.04) when compared to 7th
graders and more likely to report moderate climate (OR = 1.58, 95%
CI 1.44–1.73). Eleventh graders were significantly more likely to be
members of the negative school climate (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.59–
1.90) when compared to 7th graders and more likely to be classified
in the high caring, participation, and safe school climate class (OR =
2.05, 95% CI 1.89–2.22).

4. Discussion and implications
To date, studies have utilized traditional variable centered approaches
for examining school climate. These studies have indicated
that caring relationships, school connectedness, meaningful participation,
and sense of safety have a protective effect on youth development
and outcomes. In addition, few studies have systematically examined
the role of race and gender in explaining school climate variation. Drawing
from a diverse statewide sample of middle and high school students,
this study utilized latent class analysis to explore whether there were
discrete groups of students who experience distinct patterns of perceived
school climate and the role of race and gender. Four classes of
school climate — some caring, connectedness, and safe; negative climate;
high caring, participation, and safe; and positive climate — were
uncovered. More than a third of students were in the positive climate
class—high levels of perceived safety, caring relationships, school connectedness,
and meaningful participation; about a tenth of the sample
were members of the negative climate class. More than half of the students
were in the some caring, connectedness, and safe climate class.
The study's findings indicated racial differences in school climate
perceptions, adding to current research on race and school climate
(Thapa et al., 2013). Non-white middle and high school students were
significantly more likely than their White counterparts to be members
of the negative climate class, which is defined by low levels of caring relationships,
school connectedness, safety, and meaningful participation.
One reason for racial differences in the latent classes of school climate
may be traced to the context of school communities serving racial minority
students. A large body of educational policy research has found
that low SES Black and Latino students are often in public schools and
districts with limited financial resources and personnel, impeding the
development and implementation of school climate programs
(Ladson-Billings, 2006; Loeb, Darling-Hammond, & Luczak, 2005). In
addition, communities surrounding schools with predominantly low
SES, black and Latino communities, often have high levels of poverty
and violence, which adversely affect a school's social and emotional climate
(Gregory, Skiba, & Noguera, 2010). Moreover, predominantly low
SES, black and Latino school communities on average have significantly
higher rates of teacher and principal turnover, suspension and expulsion
rates, truancy, and gang membership, which are factors known to
affect a school's climate (Gregory et al., 2010; Skiba, Michael, Nardo, &
Peterson, 2002).
This study found that higher grade is a significant factor in predicting
membership in the poor school climate class. This confirms findings
from past studies, which have indicated that students in high school
feel more disengagement from school, report few caring adults, and
feel less connected to peers (Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; Pianta &
Allen, 2008; Thapa et al., 2013). One potential reason for this finding
could be the structure of middle and high schools. As students move
through middle and high school grades, they have multiple teachers according
to subject, may be tracked according to their ability, and thus,
have less time to develop caring relationships with teachers and other
school adults (Pianta & Allen, 2008). Moreover, adolescents in large
and comprehensive high school environments may feel isolated.
More research incorporating large samples of students in different
geographic locations are needed to investigate demographic differences
in perceived school climate. Such knowledge would be useful for educational
policymakers and school leaders interested in gaining a more
complete understanding of how students feel in schools, as well as differences
in how social groups (e.g. race, gender, grade, and other social
groups) experience school climate. This enhanced understanding of climate
would help leaders become more proactive in improving school
climate programs and interventions and the academic, social, and emotional
outcomes for all youth.
4.1. Limitations and future directions
The present study provides detailed knowledge about school climate
in California schools, however, there are limitations that must be noted.
First, the data are cross-sectional, and thus causality cannot be explored.
Second, as with much research on school climate, this study assesses
school climate through self-reported survey items from the California
Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS). Future school climate research should incorporate
observable measures of school climate, such as school suspension
and expulsion rates, truancy, and teacher retention. This
research could help validate school climate studies using self-reported
survey data. Third, we recognize that socioeconomic status is a critical
demographic variable needed in future school climate research, however,
the 2011–2013 California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) does not have
items for SES. Research has found that socioeconomic context can adversely
impact student outcomes, including mental health and academic
achievement. Astor et al. (2010) found that a school environment
where adults demonstrate care for students, provide opportunities for
meaningful participation, and promote physical safety acts as a buffer
against the stress of neighborhood poverty. Future latent class analyses
of school climate could examine associations between socioeconomic
status and discrete classes of school climate. Studies could also explore
how school climate mitigates the relationships between socioeconomic
status and student outcomes. Fourth, this study did not explore associations
between the latent classes of school climate and student outcomes.
We recommend that future studies incorporate LCA to explore
relationships between school climate and an array of student outcomes
such as victimization, substance use, academic achievement, and mental
health. Last, we recommend that future latent class analyses of
school climate explore within-school variation and school factors moderating
associations between latent classes of school climate, race, gender,
grade level, and other student demographic factors. Such research
would help deepen knowledge of patterns of school climate perceptions
among secondary students.
5. Conclusion
Few studies to date have attempted to explore the heterogenous
patterns of school climate and differences among students. Utilizing latent
class analysis (LCA), this study examined the mutually constitutive
dimensions of perceived school climate. The findings of this study indicated
four distinguished classes of school climate. Race and grade level
significantly predicted class membership, however, associations between
gender and school climate class were not significant. This study
found that Black, Latino, and Asian students were more likely to be
members of the negative school climate class, when compared to their
White counterparts. Findings from this study provide policy makers
and leaders with a more complete understanding of school climate in
middle and high schools throughout California.
