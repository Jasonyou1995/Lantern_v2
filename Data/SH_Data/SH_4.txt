Examining the Intersection of Bullying and Physical Relationship Violence Among New York City High School Students




Abstract
Research is just beginning to explore the intersection of bullying and relationship
violence. The relationship between these forms of youth aggression has yet
to be examined in diverse urban centers, including New York City (NYC).
This study seeks to identify intersections of joint victimization from bullying
and electronic bullying (e-bullying) with physical relationship violence (pRV).
This study examines data from the NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS),
a representative sample of NYC public high school students, to assess the
concurrent victimization from bullying at school and e-bullying with pRV,
operationalized as physical violence by a dating partner in the past 12 months.
Students who reported being bullied at school and e-bullied had increased
odds (bullied: OR = 2.5, 95% CI [2.1, 2.9]; e-bullied: OR = 3.0, 95% CI [2.6,
3.5]) of also being victimized by pRV compared with those who did not
report being bullied or e-bullied. In logistic regression models, being bullied
at school and being e-bullied remained significant predictors of students’ odds

of reporting pRV (bullied: AOR = 2.6, 95% CI [2.2, 3.1]; e-bullied: AOR =
3.0, 95% CI [2.5, 3.6]) while controlling for race, gender, sexual orientation,
and age. This research is the first to assess the intersection of victimization
from bullying and e-bullying with pRV in a large, diverse, random sample
of urban high school students. In this sample, students who report being
bullied or e-bullied are more likely also to report pRV than students who
have not been bullied or e-bullied. This research has potential implications for
educators, adolescent health and social service providers, and policy makers
to tailor programs and enact policies that jointly address bullying and pRV.
Future studies are needed to longitudinally assess both victimization from and
perpetration of bullying and pRV.

Peer aggression in the form of bullying, electronic bullying (e-bullying), and
physical relationship violence (pRV) continues to plague youth in the United
States. Studies have consistently shown that more than a quarter of students
experience involvement in bullying (Nansel et al., 2001; Seals & Young,
2003; Wang, Iannotti, & Nansel, 2009). Similarly, more than 30% of teenagers
have experienced physical aggression within a dating relationship, and
even higher numbers of teenagers have experienced technology-assisted dating
violence (Stonard, Bowen, Lawrence, & Price, 2014). Research is beginning
to show that students who have been victimized by one form of peer
aggression are at higher risk of further victimization from other forms of peer
aggression. However, this nascent research has yet to investigate the intersection
of bullying with pRV in diverse settings. This study investigates the relationship
of bullying and e-bullying with pRV in a large, diverse, urban sample
of high school students while controlling for important demographic
covariates.
Bullying can be defined as any behavior that meets the following three
criteria: verbal or physical aggression, repeated over time, and involving a
power differential (Olweus, 1993). Bullying can take on numerous forms
including verbal bullying (e.g., teasing, name calling, spreading rumors),
physical bullying (e.g., pushing, hitting, pinching), or relational bullying
(defined by Crick and Grotpeter, 1995, as “purposeful attempts to harm
another’s social relationships,” p. 712, such as social exclusion, spreading
rumors, or manipulating friendships). E-bullying (also called cyberbullying) 
Peters et al. 51
refers to aggressive behaviors repeated over time that use technology to exert
power over another individual (Smith et al., 2008). This includes spreading
rumors about, teasing, or threatening someone using e-mail, text messages,
chat rooms, or social media (David-Ferdon & Hertz, 2007). Relationship violence
refers to the use of physical, emotional, and/or psychological aggression
by an individual to exert control over a dating partner (Wolfe et al.,
1996). This article will focus solely on pRV, which is defined by physical
aggression (e.g., hitting, slapping, pushing, grabbing) within a dating relationship.
One major distinction exists between bullying/e-bullying and pRV;
bullies and their victims are not necessarily friends or wanting to become
friends, whereas pRV occurs between individuals who share a romantic or
sexual relationship.
Youth who are bullied, e-bullied, and/or experience pRV are at an increased
risk for many adverse health and social outcomes, many of which overlap.
Youth who have been bullied report higher rates of suicidal ideation (Robinson
& Espelage, 2012), depression (Fitzpatrick, Dulin, & Piko, 2010), and substance
use (Nansel et al., 2001) than those who have not been bullied.
E-bullying has a greater association with suicidal ideation than does traditional
bullying (van Geel, Vedder, & Tanilon, 2014). Similarly, victims of
pRV also report higher rates of suicidal ideation (Belshaw, Siddique, Tanner,
& Osho, 2012), depression, substance use (Exner-Cortens, Eckenrode, &
Rothman, 2013), eating disorders, and smoking (Bonomi, Anderson, Nemeth,
Rivara, & Buettner, 2013) than those who have not been victimized. Victims
of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV report more negative attitudes toward school
and poorer school performance than students without those experiences
(Banyard & Cross, 2008). Poor school performance can have long-term psychological,
physical, and economic consequences. Victimization from pRV
and bullying often begets violence and aggression in the victim. Youth often
engage in reactive violence to avert victimization to pRV (Lamis, Leenaars,
Jahn, & Lester, 2013) and perpetrate violence in retaliation to being bullied
(Swearer, Song, Cary, Eagle, & Mickelson, 2001). The negative health
behaviors and outcomes of victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV
are extensive and pervasive. These forms of aggression have immediate
effects on the mental and physical health of victims, and many of these effects
persist long after the initial victimization.
Although pRV can be mutual within dating relationships (Messinger, Fry,
Rickert, Cattallozzi, & Davidson, 2014; Palmetto, Davidson, Breitbart, &
Rickert, 2013; Stonard et al., 2014), many instances of bullying, e-bullying,
and pRV share one important similarity: They are often rooted in the unequal
distribution of power within a social relationship, where an individual uses
physical, verbal, and emotional coercion to intimidate another individual. 
52 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)
Researchers have expressed concern that youth who bully to maintain power
and control among peers may also exhibit these aggressive behaviors in their
dating relationships (Connolly, Peplar, Craig, & Tarandash, 2000; Fredland,
2008). In addition, with the increased use of technology to communicate
among youth, electronic aggression has emerged as a major public health
concern, both in peer relationships and dating relationships (Stonard et al.,
2014). Better understanding how these forms of youth aggression intersect
will help inform policy and programs that protect youth.
Initial research on the intersection of bullying and pRV has shown significant
overlap, suggesting that those involved in one form of youth aggression
are at higher risk of involvement in other forms of aggression. Connolly and
colleagues (2000) assessed the dating activities of elementary students in a
Canadian city who had been identified as bullies compared with a cohort of
fellow students who were not bullies. They found that youth who bullied
started dating earlier and were more likely to report being physically aggressive
with a boyfriend or girlfriend than their non-bully peers. Pepler and colleagues
(2006) assessed the intersection of perpetration of bullying with
perpetration of sexual harassment and dating aggression among 1,896 students
in Grades 7 to 12 in a Canadian city. They found significant correlations
between perpetration of bullying and perpetration of both sexual harassment
and pRV. Espelage and Holt (2007) were the first to show that victims of bullying
also reported increased victimization from pRV compared with students
who had not been bullied. Similar findings emerged in a recent study among
predominantly White students from rural New York, suburban New Jersey,
and urban Pennsylvania; Yahner, Dank, Zweig, and Lachman (2015) found
that students who were bullied were 1.5 times as likely to also be victimized
by relationship violence. Other researchers have begun to explore the intersection
of bullying and other forms of youth aggression, including the possible
pathway(s) leading from bullying to sexual bullying (e.g., sexual
teasing, unwarranted touching/pinching, indecent exposure, or sexual rumors)
to pRV (Espelage, Basile, & Hamburger, 2012; Fredland, 2008; Miller et al.,
2013).
Most studies that have investigated bullying and pRV focus on middle
school cohorts in rural and suburban areas in middle America (Espelage &
Holt, 2007; Robinson & Espelage, 2012). Research has yet to examine the
intersection of victimization from different forms of bullying with pRV
among high school students or in large urban areas. Preston (2009) highlights
numerous characteristics of urban schools that may increase aggressive
behaviors of students, including racially/ethnically diverse student populations,
large student-to-teacher ratios, and large immigrant populations.
Although studies have shown mixed results regarding increased prevalence 
Peters et al. 53
of peer victimization in urban compared with rural areas (Hickman, Jaycox,
& Aronoff, 2004; Marquart, Nannini, Edwards, Stanley, & Wayman, 2007;
Spencer & Bryant, 2000), youth in urban areas are more likely to experience
violence of all varieties than students in rural and suburban areas (Ousey,
2000). The present study will complement the existing literature by studying
the intersection of bullying and e-bullying with pRV in a representative population-based
sample of high school students in NYC, a large urban center
that is unique in its size and socioeconomic diversity.
Technology has increasingly offered new media for youth who wish to
victimize their peers, sparking concern among policy makers, practitioners,
and researchers. Technology offers perpetrators of bullying nearly universal
access to their victims through social media, text messaging, and other forms
of online communication. Similarly, dating partners are able to better communicate
with each other through enhancements in technology, but as with
e-bullying, dating partners also have new ways to exert control within relationships
using technology. Recent research has uncovered a notable relationship
between e-bullying and electronic relationship violence (e-RV) among
youth. In a sample of 351 young adults, Hoff and Mitchell (2009) found that
e-bullying often emerged as a result of relationship problems. Further
research revealed that students who were e-bullied were 2 to 3 times as likely
to also experience e-RV than those who were not e-bullied (Hinduja &
Patchin, 2011; Zweig, Dank, Lachman, & Yahner, 2013). However, research
has yet to investigate whether victims of e-bullying are at greater risk of
experiencing pRV.
Theoretical Frameworks
Numerous theories have been used to help explain victimization from youth
violence. These theories focus on various levels of influence, ranging from
the individual to the interpersonal to the social environment. This study will
draw on the developmental victimization framework, which suggests that
victims of various forms of aggression share overlapping risk factors
(Finkelhor & Asdigian, 1996; Finkelhor & Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994). This
framework posits that once an individual is victimized, he or she begins to
exhibit personality and behavioral characteristics that put him or her at risk
for future victimization. Others have invoked attribution theory to explain
multiple forms of victimization (Graham & Juvonen, 2001); victims of
aggression may attribute the victimization experience as an internal and
uncontrollable characteristic. This self-blame may normalize future victimization
experiences, thereby putting individuals at risk for further
victimization.
54 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)
Certain demographic groups are at higher risk for stigmatization than others,
which may put them at higher risk for joint victimization from bullying
or e-bullying and pRV. According to social stress theory, individuals in stigmatized
social groups are subjected to added stress due to their minority status
(Meyer, 2003). Individuals of minority sexual orientations experience
more external stressful events, often in the form of bullying, than their peers.
Similarly, racial prejudice and discrimination have been described as a unique
class of stressors (Williams & Mohammed, 2009) because those in the racial
majority seek to maintain their socially superior status by degrading racial
minorities through social and behavioral means. Increased victimization
from bullying based on stigma and discrimination faced by minority youth
may increase their likelihood of attributing the experience as self-blame,
thereby increasing their likelihood for future victimization.
This study will also investigate whether the relationship between bullying
or e-bullying and pRV is found in this large population-based sample and
whether it remains after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics,
including sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and gender. These covariates
have been shown in prior research to be associated with bullying, e-bullying,
and pRV separately, suggesting potential confounding of the relationship
between bullying and e-bullying with pRV. However, we are unaware of any
studies that assess these covariates as potential confounders when assessing
the intersection of bullying and e-bullying with pRV.
Sexual orientation plays a notable role in students’ risk of peer victimization.
The National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) from 2001 to 2009,
which includes 41 states and 21 large urban school districts, has consistently
shown that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth are at greater risk of victimization
from bullying than heterosexual youth (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011). LGB youth are also at greater risk of
pRV. In a separate survey of more than 5,000 7th to 12th graders in New
York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, LGB youth reported much higher rates
of victimization from all forms of relationship violence than heterosexual
youth, including pRV (42% vs. 29%, respectively), psychological dating
abuse (59% vs. 46%), and cyber dating abuse (37% vs. 25%; Dank, Lachman,
Zweig, & Yahner, 2014). Zweig and colleagues (2013) highlight the need to
further examine the overlap of cyberbullying and pRV, especially regarding
LGB youth.
Race/ethnicity has also been shown to be associated with pRV. According
to the 2011 National YRBS, Black and Hispanic students report experiencing
pRV at higher rates than non-Hispanic White students (CDC, 2012). However,
racial and ethnic differences in victimization from bullying have been studied
to a lesser degree, and the few existing studies have produced conflicting 
Peters et al. 55
results. In a nationally representative sample of more than 11,000 students in
Grades 6 to 10, African American students were less likely to be victimized
by bullying than White and Hispanic students (Spriggs, Iannotti, Nansel, &
Haynie, 2007). Other studies have shown similar rates of being bullied across
racial groups (Estell, Farmer, & Cairns, 2007; Graham & Juvonen, 2002),
and still others have shown higher rates of bullying victimization among
African American students compared with other racial/ethnic groups, particularly
in urban settings (Goldweber, Waasdorp, & Bradshaw, 2013).
Similar to race/ethnicity, research on the role that gender plays in youths’
risk of peer victimization has produced inconsistent results. A greater number
of boys report being physically bullied than girls, and more girls report experiencing
victimization from verbal bullying, relational bullying (Crick &
Nelson, 2002; Seals & Young, 2003), and cyberbullying (21% vs. 12%) than
boys (New York Statewide School Health Services Center [NYSSHSC],
2013). Studies have reported different conclusions regarding gender and victimization
from pRV, which is due in part to the way that pRV is defined in
the measures used (e.g., behavior vs. intent to harm or severity of harm). In a
study of young women (15-24), they reported more frequently using physical
violence against their male partners that they reported receiving from the
same partner (Palmetto et al., 2013). In the 2011 National YRBS, boys
reported experiencing more minor pRV than girls (CDC, 2012). However, in
a national survey of more than 20,000 students in predominantly rural communities,
girls reported experiencing more severe pRV than boys in each
region of the country (Marquart et al., 2007).
Drawing on the above research, the purpose of this study is to examine the
association between victimization from bullying and e-bullying with victimization
from pRV among a large random, representative sample of public
high school students in NYC. NYC is the largest city in the United States,
with a diverse mix of cultures and constant streams of migration and immigration
(New York City Department of City Planning, 2013). Consequently,
existing research on the relationship between victimization from bullying/
e-bullying with pRV may not generalize to urban youth in NYC. Furthermore,
this research will examine whether the intersection between bullying and
e-bullying with pRV remains when accounting for sexual orientation, gender,
race/ethnicity, and age. This research seeks to answer the following
questions:
Research Question 1: Are students who report being bullied or e-bullied
more likely to also report experiencing pRV compared with students who
do not report being bullied or e-bullied?
56 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)
Research Question 2: Does the association between bullying and
e-bullying with pRV among NYC high school students remain significant
after controlling for gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and age?
We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 1: Students who are bullied or e-bullied will be more likely to
also report victimization from pRV than students who are not bullied or
e-bullied.
Hypothesis 2: The association between bullying and e-bullying with pRV
will remain significant after adjusting for covariates of interest.
By empirically identifying the relationship between victimization from
bullying/e-bullying with pRV in NYC, this research could help inform prevention
initiatives, response strategies, and youth aggression policies, specifically
in urban schools.
Method
NYC YRBS
This research analyzes data collected in the 2011 NYC YRBS. The YRBS
measures demographics, environmental factors, experiences, and behaviors
of public high school students in Grades 9 to 12 that potentially put them at
risk for numerous adverse health outcomes. The NYC Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) administers the YRBS biennially in collaboration
with the NYC Department of Education and the CDC. In 2011, about
11,570 high school students from 102 schools completed the NYC YRBS
with school and student response rates of 93% and 79%, respectively, yielding
a 73% overall response rate (NYC DOHMH, 2012).
Sampling Procedure
The 2011 NYC DOHMH selected a representative sample of public high
school students for the YRBS using a two-stage cluster sample design. First,
schools were randomly selected across the five boroughs of NYC. In the
second stage of sampling, classrooms were selected from either a required
subject (i.e., social studies) or a required period (i.e., homeroom), mirroring
the final stage of the CDC’s three-stage sampling methodology for the
national YRBS (CDC, 2012). Consequently, students who did not attend
these required classes because they were in non-mainstream programs were 
Peters et al. 57
excluded from the sampling frame, including students in English as Second
Language (ESL) and special education programs. All assenting students in
the selected classrooms at selected schools anonymously completed the selfadministered
questionnaire. After data were collected, each student’s
responses were weighted based on their probabilities of selection, nonresponse
to questions, and other stratified adjustments. In addition to students
who were solely in ESL and special education classes, the YRBS survey
design excluded students who attended private or charter schools, were
absent from school on the day of the questionnaire, had dropped out, or were
incarcerated. More details on the survey and data set can be found at the NYC
YRBS website (NYC DOHMH, 2012).
Measures
Dependent and predictor variables. The dependent variable of pRV was measured
by the following YRBS item: “During the past 12 months, did your
boyfriend or girlfriend ever hit, slap, or physically hurt you on purpose?”
Responses were coded dichotomously. In a 1999 study of the test–retest reliability
of the YRBS, this pRV item received a kappa statistic of 56%, falling
between the moderate (41%) to substantial (61%) range of reliability (Brener
et al., 2002).
Two exposure variables were included in this study: (a) victimization from
bullying at school and (b) victimization from e-bullying. The former was
measured using the item, “During the past 12 months, have you ever been
bullied on school property?” The latter was measured using the item, “During
the past 12 months, have you ever been electronically bullied? (Include being
bullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting.)”
Responses were coded dichotomously. In the 2011 YRBS, these two questions
are prefaced with a short description of what constitutes bullying:
“when one or more students tease, threaten, spread rumors about, hit, shove,
or hurt another student repeatedly.” The questions were also prefaced with a
description of what should not be considered bullying: “when two students of
about the same strength . . . argue, fight, or tease each other in a friendly
way.” Test–retest reliability has not been assessed as victimization from bullying
and e-bullying were added to the NYC YRBS in 2009 (CDC, 2013).
Covariates. Several demographic covariates were considered when investigating
the intersection of victimization from bullying and e-bullying with
pRV, including gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and grade.
Gender was defined as male and female in the YRBS. The NYC YRBS
includes separate items for ethnicity and race: (a) “Are you Hispanic or 
58 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)
Latino?” and (b) “What is your race?” Participants could choose multiple
responses for race, which included American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian;
Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and
White. In this study, race was grouped into five categories, which were White,
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and other (which included
American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, and
multiple non-Hispanic due to their low frequencies in the sample). Grade was
measured as 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and “ungraded/other” grades, and age was
measured as 12 or younger, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years or older. Sexual
orientation was defined using the YRBS item, “How would you describe
yourself?” with responses of straight/heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, and
unsure. In this study, respondents who reported being unsure (n = 372) were
analyzed separately from lesbian/gay, bisexual, and heterosexual respondents,
consistent with current recommendations (Badgett & Goldberg, 2009).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated using frequencies for the “bullied at
school,” “e-bullied,” and “pRV” variables to determine the prevalence of students
experiencing each form of violence. The prevalence of these variables
was also disaggregated by gender, race/ethnicity, sexual identity, grade, and
age to investigate which demographic groups reported the highest rates of
youth victimization by bullying, e-bullying, and pRV separately. As shown in
Table 1, the small number of students who reported being 12 years or younger
(n = 36) and being in “another grade” or ungraded (n = 64) had very different
victimization experiences from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV than their fellow
students. Given the small sample sizes of these two groups and their
notably different experiences from that of the others, we excluded them in all
subsequent analyses.
Chi-square tests were performed to explore the relationship between each
of the bullying variables (“bullied on school property” and “e-bullied”) and
the pRV variable to assess the unadjusted odds of being both bullied or e-bullied
and physically abused by a dating partner. After the unadjusted relationships
were defined, adjusted estimates were calculated through logistic
regression. The correlation between bullied and e-bullied (φ coefficient =
0.35) fell between a medium (0.3) and large (0.5) effect size (Pallant, 2010),
and therefore “bullied at school” and “e-bullied” were assessed in separate
models. The first model included being bullied at school as the predictor variable
and the second included being e-bullied as the predictor variable. Each
logistic regression model also included covariates that were significantly
associated with both the predictors (bullied and e-bullied) and the outcome

with age.
All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.3 using weighted data from the
NYC DOHMH.
Results
Respondents were 53% female, 46% Hispanic or Latino, 27% Black or
African American, 11.6% White, and 9.2% Asian. Respondents were fairly
evenly distributed across the grade levels, with 28% in the 9th grade, 26% in
the 10th, 24% in the 11th, and 22% in 12th. Most respondents reported that
they were straight/heterosexual (86%), with 2.8% identifying as gay/lesbian,
7.2% as bisexual, and 3.8% of respondents reporting that they were “unsure”
of their sexual orientation. More than 90% of respondents were between the
ages of 13 and 17 (Table 1).
Girls and boys reported being bullied at similar rates (Table 1), but more
girls reported being e-bullied than boys (12.7% vs. 8.7%; p < .001).
Conversely, boys reported victimization from pRV at higher rates than girls
(11.1% vs. 9.4%; p = .004). Significant group differences were observed
between gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents compared with heterosexual/straight
adolescents. A higher percentage of gay/lesbian (18.6% bullied,
19.9% e-bullied, 25.3% pRV; p < .001), bisexual (17.1% bullied, 18.9%
e-bullied, 18.1% pRV; p < .001), and students who were unsure of their sexual
orientation (17% bullied, 17.5% e-bullied, 14.9% pRV; p < .001) reported
victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV compared with straight/
heterosexual students (10.6% bullied, 9.8% e-bullied, 8.5% pRV). More
White students reported being bullied and e-bullied than Black, Hispanic,
and Asian students. Fewer White and Asian students reported pRV than Black
and Hispanic students (7.3%, 6.6%, 9%, and 10.8%, respectively; p < .001).
Next, cross-tabulations were performed to assess the prevalence, and odds
ratios were calculated of reporting pRV as well as being bullied at school or
e-bullied in the last 12 months (Table 2). In the last 12 months, 11.7% reported
being bullied on school property, 11% reported being e-bullied, and 10.4%
reported being physically abused by a boyfriend or girlfriend. Of the students
who reported being bullied in school in the past 12 months, 19.2% also reported
being victims of pRV equating to 2.5 times the odds (95% CI [2.1, 2.9]) of also
being victimized by pRV compared with those who were not bullied. Similarly,
of the students who reported being e-bullied in the past 12 months, 21.9% also
reported being victims of pRV, equating to 3 times the odds (95% CI [2.6, 3.5])
of reporting victimization from pRV than peers who were not e-bullied.

Victimization from bullying and e-bullying also significantly overlapped;
40.4% of students who reported being bullied also reported being e-bullied
(Table 2) equating to 9.6 times the odds (95% CI [8.3, 11]) of also reporting
being e-bullied compared with peers who were not bullied. A Venn diagram
was created to illustrate the intersection of victimization from bullying, e-bullying,
and pRV (Figure 1). Overall, 3,723 students (32.2%) reported being victimized
by at least one of these three forms of youth aggression. Just over 2,000

students (17.9% of the total sample) reported victimization from bullying at
school, e-bullying, or both, and of those students, 382 (5.3% of the total sample)
also experienced pRV. A higher percentage of respondents reported victimization
by all three forms of aggression (1.27%) than being bullied and pRV
(0.97%) or being e-bullied and pRV (1.17%).
Finally, logistic regression was performed using two models to predict the
likelihood that students reported being victimized by pRV. The first model
included being bullied at school as the predictor and the second model
included being e-bullied. Both models were adjusted for gender, race/ethnicity,
sexual orientation, and age. In the first model (Table 3), students who
reported being bullied had 2.6 times the odds (95% CI [2.2, 3.1]) of also
experiencing pRV compared with those who were not bullied, controlling for
the covariates of interest. In the second model (Table 3), students who
reported being e-bullied had 3.0 times the odds (95% CI [2.5, 3.6]) of also
experiencing pRV compared with those who were not e-bullied, controlling
for the covariates of interest.

high school students and is among the first to look at these interrelationships
in general. In addition, this research is among the first to address potential
confounding by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and age on joint
victimization from bullying and e-bullying with pRV. The findings from this
study add to the overall understanding of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV,
showing that victimization from bullying and e-bullying is strongly associated
with pRV. The main findings of this research can be summarized in three
main points.
First, victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV affects a substantial
portion of NYC students. Univariate analyses were mostly consistent
with published literature, showing that certain populations were significantly
more likely to experience bullying, e-bullying, or RV separately. Similar to
published literature (CDC, 2011; Dank et al., 2014), LGB students and students
who were unsure of their sexual orientation had higher rates of all three
forms of aggression than their heterosexual peers. Also consistent with published
literature (CDC, 2012), Black and Hispanic/Latino students reported
experiencing more relationship violence than students.
Bullying and e-bullying tended to decrease with age and grade whereas
pRV tended to increase with age and grade, though the associations persisted
despite the differing age trends. In this study, Black students reported lower
rates of being bullied and e-bullied than White and Hispanic students, differing
from recent findings that Black students are at higher risk of being bullied
(Goldweber et al., 2013). The sample in the study by Goldweber and colleagues
was predominantly White (62.4%), whereas the sample in this study
was predominantly Black and Hispanic (27% and 26%, respectively), which
may have led to these discrepant findings.
The second main finding shows that students who are bullied or e-bullied
have much higher odds (ORs of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively) of victimization
from pRV compared with those who have not been bullied or e-bullied. These
findings regarding bullying and pRV co-occurrence support the limited prior
research (Espelage & Holt, 2007; Yahner et al., 2015). In addition, the findings
regarding the co-occurrence of e-bullying and pRV provide new insights
into teen violence, and complement findings that show significant co-occurrence
of e-bullying with a different outcome of e-dating violence (Hinduja &
Patchin, 2011). Although there is significant overlap in victimization from
these three forms of youth aggression, a majority of students who report any
victimization still only report being victimized by a single form: either bullied,
e-bullied, or victimized by pRV.
The third major finding of this research shows that the relationship
between being bullied or e-bullied with victimization from pRV remained
essentially unchanged and still significant after adjusting for race, gender, 
66 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)
sexual orientation, and age. The lack of confounding in the present study suggests
that once students experience victimization from bullying or e-bullying,
their odds of victimization from pRV are higher regardless of their sociodemographic
characteristics.
Implications for Policy and Practice
Nearly all states have enacted bullying legislation, with 31 states specifically
addressing e-bullying (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2014a,
2014b). Evaluations of anti-bullying policies have shown protective effects
against adverse health outcomes, especially those policies that include sexual-orientation-specific
language, for specific subpopulations (i.e., lesbian
and gay youth; Hatzenbuehler & Keyes, 2013). States have increasingly
implemented anti-dating violence policies in schools. As of January 2014, 21
states (excluding New York) have introduced legislation that requires schools
to incorporate information on pRV into their curricula (National Conference
of State Legislatures, 2014c), yet most pRV policies in schools are separate
from bullying policies. School policies that address bullying, e-bullying, and
pRV jointly may help address the intersection of bullying and e-bullying with
pRV. Rhode Island has innovatively integrated dating violence policies into
existing school bullying policies. Rhode Island passed a law requiring each
school to draft a dating violence policy that includes teacher and staff trainings
and age-appropriate dating violence curricula for students in Grades 7 to
12. However, rather than creating a separate policy to address RV in schools,
Rhode Island expanded the existing bullying and e-bullying policy to include
these new dating violence training and education mandates (Rhode Island
Department of Education, 2012). Combining policy and programmatic
approaches in schools might provide economies of scale but, to our knowledge,
this combined policy has yet to be evaluated for efficacy, and we recommend
a rigorous evaluation to inform further enactment of joint or separate
bullying/e-bullying and pRV school policies. Expanding current efforts into a
comprehensive school aggression policy may enable schools to feasibly
streamline reporting and investigation protocols as well as prevention efforts.
The effects of comprehensive policies need to be empirically validated
through future evaluation.
In addition to policy-level approaches, interventions and programs can be
pursued that address bullying and pRV jointly. Researchers have suggested
that prevention interventions focus on multiple domains of aggression,
including bullying and pRV if, in fact, they do co-occur (Ozer, Tschann,
Pasch, & Flores, 2004). The findings from this research support this view.
Interventions addressing multiple domains of aggression have shown 
Peters et al. 67
positive results in preventing youth violence and the associated long-term
health outcomes. To reduce pRV, Safe Spaces chose to intervene early in
elementary school through a bullying and sexual harassment prevention program
with the belief that tolerating violence early in childhood allows children
the freedom to perpetrate bullying and pRV later in adolescence (Sanchez
et al., 2001). Students in intervention schools had increased knowledge
related to sexual harassment, better recognition of bullying at school, and
increased willingness to intervene as bystanders compared with students in
comparison schools. Espelage, Low, Polanin, and Brown (2013) recently
implemented and evaluated a similar intervention among middle schools in
the Midwest (Illinois and Kansas) to reduce youth aggression and sexual violence.
Preliminary results showed decreased physical aggression in intervention
schools compared with control schools (Espelage et al., 2013). Other
interventions have been described that seek to address both bullying and pRV
among students (Fredland, 2010) and promote healthy relationships among
peers and dating partners (Wolfe et al., 2009). Despite implementation challenges
and a lack of preliminary outcomes, these interventions used novel
prevention approaches for multiple domains of aggression that should be
revisited, adapted, and improved in other settings.
Future Research
This research focused solely on individual-level risk factors of victimization
from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV. Future research should investigate potential
environmental and community factors that increase students’ risk of joint
victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV, such as family violence,
community violence, and school climate. Also, studies of the intersection of
bullying and e-bullying with pRV should investigate perpetration in addition
to victimization, given that students who are victimized by bullying, e-bullying,
and pRV often also perpetrate these forms of aggression (Swearer et al.,
2001). The YRBS does not include questions on other important aspects of
relationship violence, given that dating aggression also includes sexual coercion
and also occurs through the use of technology. In addition, research has
yet to investigate whether students who experience joint victimization from
these three forms of aggression experience different or more severe adverse
health outcomes. Health outcomes specific to joint victimization should be a
focus of future research.
Temporal causality cannot be inferred about the relationship between victimization
from bullying/e-bullying and pRV due to the cross-sectional nature
of the NYC YRBS. Future research should utilize a longitudinal design that
assesses perpetration and victimization of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV, 
68 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)
allowing for a better understanding of the development of these forms of
coercion over time. The bullying–sexual violence pathway that has been proposed
in the literature suggests that bullying begins very early in childhood
(Espelage et al., 2012). Therefore, longitudinal studies should begin with
children early in their schooling to gain a detailed understanding of this
pathway.
Limitations and Strengths
There are limitations to this study regarding sampling and measurement.
These findings only represent public high school students in NYC and are not
generalizable to behaviors of students who attend private and charter schools,
are home schooled, or do not attend school. LGB students are more likely to
stay home from school due to fear of victimization than heterosexual students
(Robinson & Espelage, 2012), potentially reducing their participation in this
survey. The level of sampling bias created by the differential exclusion of
students who were frequent school absentees cannot be determined from the
data available in the NYC YRBS.
In addition, victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV were all
measured by single questions. Each of these forms of aggression comprises a
complex set of behaviors, mentalities, and circumstances. Using single-item
measures may miss the nuanced complexities of perceived bullying, e-bullying,
and pRV. This narrow operationalization could threaten the content
validity of this study by differentially representing or misrepresenting the
constructs of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV. In a recent review of pRV among
teenagers, surveys that used multi-item scales consistently reported prevalence
rates of pRV at 20% to 25% of the survey population, whereas studies
that relied on the single-item scale in the YRBS reported half the prevalence
rates (Stonard et al., 2014). This suggests that YRBS measures underrepresent
the constructs of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV. In addition, this study
was unable to assess perpetration, severity, or frequency of victimization, and
other forms of RV, including sexual and psychological RV. Last, the NYC
YRBS relies on self-report data from high school students about their behaviors,
experiences, and identities. Self-reports in self-administered surveys
introduce the possibility of numerous forms of biases (Podsakoff & Organ,
1986). However, self-reported measures of bullying victimization are found
to be preferable to peer and teacher nomination when the purpose of the study
is to assess the experiences of all students in a given school (Espelage &
Swearer, 2003).
Despite these limitations, this research has many design attributes that
bolster the strength of the findings. The NYC YRBS uses a large, random 
Peters et al. 69
sample of urban high school students from diverse backgrounds and neighborhoods.
This research provides a solid foundation for practitioners and
policy makers to rethink programmatic and policy strategies, as well as
directing future research into joint victimization of bullying and dating
violence.
Conclusion
Victimization from bullying (both at school and electronic) and pRV significantly
co-occur among high school students in NYC after controlling for
race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or age. These experiences undoubtedly
affect students in adverse ways. Although further research is needed on
joint victimization that includes joint perpetration and the direction of temporal
causation, policy makers, practitioners, and school administrators should
consider the findings of this research, within the existing state of the literature,
to strategically combine resources for bullying, e-bullying, and pRV
prevention and intervention.

Author Biographies
Zachary J. Peters is a research coordinator at ICAP at Columbia University, in the
Mailman School of Public Health. He recently graduated from the Mailman School of
Public Health in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences with a concentration in
health promotion, research and practice. He has worked in the areas of domestic violence
with a focus on teen dating violence, HIV prevention in domestic and global
settings, and health promotion among populations affected by incarceration. Currently,
he is working on several studies seeking to identify clinic-, household-, and individual-level
factors that affect provision of and access to HIV care and treatment in several
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Mark L. Hatzenbuehler is an assistant professor in the Department of Sociomedical
Sciences in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University where he
co-directs the Center for the study of social inequalities and health at Columbia. He is
a leading expert on structural stigma, a concept that refers to societal-level conditions,
cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the opportunities, resources,
and well-being of the stigmatized. His work has focused on how social policies that
differentially target gays and lesbians for social exclusion affect the mental health of
lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations. He has published extensively in the
areas of stigma, social/contextual determinants of sexual orientation health disparities,
and psychological mechanisms linking stigma to health. He has received multiple
awards for this research, including the James B. Grossman Dissertation Prize from
Yale University, the Division 44 Maylon Smith Award from the American
Psychological Association, the Kenneth Lutterman and Walter J. Lear Awards from
the American Public Health Association, and the Emerson Award from Harvard
Medical School for excellence in published psychological research. He was invited to 
Peters et al. 75
present his research on anti-bullying policies as part of an expert panel at the CDC and
as part of an Institute of Medicine Workshop on Building Capacity to Reduce Bullying
and its Impact on Youth Across the Lifecourse. He is currently funded on a K01
award from National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to identify social determinants
of sexual-orientation-related disparities in substance use and HIV risk disparities.
Leslie L. Davidson is a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the Columbia
University Medical Center, in the Mailman School of Public Health and College of
Physicians and Surgeons, where she currently leads the doctoral programs in epidemiology.
She worked throughout her career in the broad areas of disability, injury, and
violence, working particularly with women, children, and adolescents. Among her
primary research interests are the epidemiology and prevention of intimate partner
violence with an emphasis on adolescents and young adults. Her research has explored
the occurrence and correlates of dating violence in a range of populations as well as a
trial of screening approaches for partner violence in young women. She has studied
the epidemiology of disability in children in low and middle income countries. She
was a member of the team of researchers evaluating the Ten Questions, a screen for
low and middle income countries with few professional resources addressing neurodevelopmental
disability. More recently, she has been principal investigator for a
cohort study of neurodevelopmental disability in preschool children in South Africa
(the Asenze Study). She was a co-investigator of a study in Benin assessing neurodisability
in children whose mothers were anemic during pregnancy. She trained in pediatrics
at Columbia, in epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene, and in child
mental health research through a postdoctoral fellowship at the Institute of Psychiatry
in London.
