Sexual Harassment Victimization and Perpetration Among High School Students




Abstract
This large, population-based study is one of the few to examine prevalence rates
of sexual harassment occurring during the past 12 months by victimization and
perpetration among adolescents. In this large, cross-sectional survey of students
attending 26 high schools, sexual harassment was defined using three questions
from the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire. Among 18,090 students completing the
survey, 30% disclosed sexual harassment victimization (37% of females, 21% of males)
and 8.5% reported perpetration (5% of females, 12% of males). Sexual harassment
perpetration was highly correlated with male sex, minority race/ethnicity, same-sex
attraction, bullying, alcohol binge drinking, and intraparental partner violence.

of University Women, 2011). Sexual harassment as it relates to the school environment
is defined as conduct that is sexual in nature, unwelcome, denies or limits a student’s
ability to participate in or benefit from a school’s education program, and
interferes with a student’s right to a supportive, respectful, and safe learning environment
(U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, 2008; Witkowska &
Kjellberg, 2005). School-based definitions also address unwanted sexual behavior that
interferes with a student’s educational opportunities, which may not be face-to-face,
including cyberbullying through text messages and other social media (Hill et al.,
2011).
It is worth noting the difference between bullying and sexual harassment. Unlike
bullying behaviors, sexual harassment incorporates a strong sexual component with
little to no physical contact. Sexual harassment is an illegal form of sex discrimination
that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, 2009) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972
(U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, 1997). When bullying is used
to describe sexual harassment, it takes away the role of gender and sex, which are key
parts of the definition (Stein & Mennemeier, 2011). Nansel and colleagues used a definition
that addressed the three components used in bullying definitions among
researchers:
Bullying is a specific type of aggression in which (1) the behavior is intended to harm or
disturb, (2) the behavior occurs repeatedly over time, (3) there is an imbalance of power
(physical or psychological), with a more powerful person or group attacking a less
powerful one. (Nansel et al., 2001, p. 2094; Salmivalli, Kaukiainen, Kaistaniemi, &
Lagerspetz, 1999; Swearer & Espelage, 2011)
Sexual harassment could be viewed as a form of non-physical aggression on a continuum
with sexual violence (Basile & Saltzman, 2002); thus, understanding correlates
of sexual harassment victimization, and particularly perpetration, could be very
important for sexual and dating violence prevention.
A review of research shows estimated rates of sexual harassment among students to
be between 23% and 87% (Attar-Schwartz, 2009; Fineran & Bennett, 1999; Harris &
Associates, 1993; Hill et al., 2011; Langelan, 1993; Lipson & American Association of
University Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Martin, 2008; McMaster, Connolly,
Pepler, & Craig, 2002; Ormerod, Collinsworth, & Perry, 2008; Permanent Commission
on the Status of Women [PCSW], 1995; Stein, Marshall, & Tropp 1993; Strauss &
Espeland, 1992). Variance in rates may be attributed to differences in the methodology
for identifying the sample, study power, and the operational definition of sexual
harassment. In a small study of 21 female students attending an alternative high school,
researchers found that 52% disclosed sexual harassment (Martin, 2008), whereas in a
much larger study of 16,604 Israeli students in Grades 7 to 11, 26% reported at least
one incident of sexual harassment (Attar-Schwartz, 2009). In a more recent study of
students in Grades 7 to 12, approximately half (48%) experienced some form of sexual
harassment in the 2010-2011 school year (Hill et al., 2011). Prior research indicated 
Clear et al. 1205
that females were more likely than males to be sexually harassed (Hill et al., 2011;
Lipson & American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001;
Ormerod et al., 2008; Sagrestano, 2009), and males were identified as perpetrators in
more than 90% of the incidents of sexual harassment against females (Fineran &
Bennett, 1999; Harris & Associates, 1993; Langelan, 1993; McMaster et al., 2002;
PCSW, 1995; Robers, Zhang, Truman, Department of Justice, & National Center for
Education Statistics, 2012; Stein et al., 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992).
The limited research that has addressed the prevalence and health impact of sexual
harassment victimization indicated that among adolescents, females were psychologically
more affected by sexual harassment, had lower self-esteem, admitted to taking
sexual harassment more personally, were victims of repeated sexual harassment, and
were more likely to attempt suicide than males (Bagley, Bolitho, & Bertrand, 1997;
Chiodo, Wolfe, Crooks, Hughes, & Jaffe, 2009; Gadin & Hammarstrom, 2005).
Multiple studies have reported students feeling angry, upset, and threatened by sexual
harassment, which contributed to lower self-esteem and confidence (Harris &
Associates, 1993; PCSW, 1995; Stein et al., 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992).
In addition to its effects on mental health, sexual harassment has consequences for
students’ school performance, specifically poor grades, absenteeism, skipping or dropping
classes, and poor school performance (Corbett & Gentry, 1993; Hand & Sanchez,
2000; Harris & Associates, 1993, 1993; Lee, Croninger, Linn, & Chen, 1996; Lipson
& American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Robers
et al., 2012). Collectively, these findings indicate a need to more comprehensively
document gender differences in sexual harassment victimization and perpetration and
to identify other demographic or social factors associated with increased risk of sexual
harassment.
The purpose of the present study was to add to the limited research available on
sexual harassment victimization and perpetration of high school students. We hypothesized
that females reported higher rates of victimization, and males disclosed higher
rates of perpetration. Rates of sexual harassment by tactic, direction, and sex were
reported, including the co-occurrence of victimization and perpetration in the past 12
months. This research fills an important gap in the existing research by providing estimates
of the frequency of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration among
adolescents and by sex and other demographic and violence risk factors.
Method
Participants
All high school students (freshmen-seniors) attending 1 of 26 participating high
schools and present during surveying were asked to complete a self-administered survey.
The survey was a 95-item anonymous paper-and-pencil questionnaire that took
approximately 25 to 40 min to complete. Between January and May 2010, study personnel
traveled to the high schools and administered surveys either in a class administration
setting in the school during a selected class (for example, English classes for 
1206 Violence Against Women 20(10)
the whole day; n = 16), or a school group administration during which the whole
school was surveyed in one class period (for example, first period; n = 10). The model
for survey administration was familiar to schools, as it was used when conducting the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2009).
All parents and guardians of enrolled students were mailed an informational letter
describing the study purpose and the types of questions to be included on the survey.
If parents or guardians did not wish for their student to participate in the survey, they
were asked to call or email with the name and school of their student. So as not to
single these students out from other classmates, study staff worked with the teachers
to identify students whose parents did not wish for them to participate on the day of
administration. Staff gave these students an identical survey booklet that did not contain
any questions, but included the same face page and instructions as well as a
Scantron® form. Students whose parents or guardians did not grant permission for
them to participate were asked to bubble in the letter J for all answers on the Scantron®
form so it would look as if they were participating.
In the classroom, all students were asked not to write their name or birth date on the
Scantron® forms. Elements of assent were read to all students by Collaborative
Institutional Training Initiative trained staff. If the methodology was a school-wide
one-period administration, a DVD with instructions was played for students. During
the all-day administrations, study staff read the assent information to each class period.
All students were directed to review the assent form in the survey booklet and decide
for themselves whether they wished to complete the survey. Those opting not to complete
the survey were asked to fill in the letter H on the Scantron® form and then
quietly remain in their seat. All survey Scantron® forms were collected at the end of
administration. Resources, including websites and toll-free numbers for national agencies
available at all times to address domestic violence, sexual assaults, depression, or
suicide ideation, were provided at the end of survey booklets. These resources were
also given on pencils the students used to complete the survey and were able to keep.
The national hotlines and websites linked individuals to local services. The study protocol
was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board
09-0680-F1V.
Measures
Three items based on the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ) were used to measure
perpetration and victimization of sexual harassment (Fitzgerald, Magley,
Drasgow, & Waldo, 1999). Items asked specifically about victimization and perpetration
using the introduction of either, “In the past 12 months, how many times did
another high school student . . .” or “In the past 12 months, how many times did YOU
. . .” Items included the following: (a) Tell you sexual stories or jokes that made you
uneasy? (b) Make gestures, rude remarks or use sexual body language to embarrass or
upset you? (c) Keep asking you out on a date or asking you to hookup although you
said “No”? Response options for all items ranged from never (0), 1 to 2 times (1), 3 to 
Clear et al. 1207
5 times (2), 6 or more times (3). The response of yes, but not in the past 12 months was
also an option but, for this analysis, we included it with never, because we were only
interested in the past 12 months, not lifetime victimization or perpetration. Students
who reported that any of the items occurred at least 3 or more times in the past 12
months were included in the sexual harassment definition. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient
for the three sexual harassment items indicated reasonable internal consistency
for victimization (α = .66) and perpetration (α = .71). We investigated the co-occurrence
of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration by specific sexual harassment
tactics by gender.
Demographic and other risk factors for sexual harassment were also evaluated.
These included gender (female and male), high school grade (freshman, sophomore,
junior, senior), race (categories summarized as non-White and White), receipt of a free
or reduced price meal (yes or no, included as a proxy for family income), and sexual
attraction (specifically, “People are different in their sexual attraction to other people.
Which best describes your feelings?” Responses included only attracted to females,
mostly attracted to females, equally attracted to females and males, mostly attracted
to males, only attracted to males, and not sure). Responses were grouped as attracted
to the opposite sex only versus attracted to the same or both sexes. The intraparental
partner violence question was as follows: “In your family, how often did you see or
hear one of your parents or guardians being hit, slapped, punched, shoved, kicked, or
otherwise physically hurt by their spouse or partner?” Response options ranged from
never to more than 10 times, but were dichotomized as yes or no. Questions regarding
being bullied or having bullied others, respectively, were as follows: “In the past 12
months, how many times have you been bullied by another high school student?” and
“In the past 12 months, how many times have you bullied another high school student?”
Response options ranged from never to more than 10 times for both questions;
we grouped answers as more than twice, 1 to 2 times, and never in the past 12 months.
There was one question on binge drinking: “In the past month, on how many days did
you have 4 (if you are a female) 5 (if you are a male) or more drinks of alcohol in a
row (within a couple of hours)?” Response options ranged from I never drink to 20 to
31 days; a dichotomous variable was created to identify those students who reported
binge drinking 1 or more days in the past 30, and at least 1 day in the past 30 days (yes
vs. no).
Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using SAS, Version 9.2. Because the purpose of this article is
to document the rates of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration in this large
high school population, adjusted rates are presented throughout Table 1 as well as
Table 3. However, when investigating gender differences in rates, we adjusted odds
ratios (aOR) for demographic factors known to be covariates, including age (freshman,
sophomore, junior, or senior), family income (the proxy of receipt of a free or
reduced price meal: yes or no), race (White or non-White), sexual attraction (exclusively
attracted to the opposite sex or not), and a history of parental or guardian partner 
1208 Violence Against Women 20(10)
violence (yes or no). In addition, these models were adjusted for the sampling design
by blocking on the sampled high school (n = 26).
Separate logistic regression models were used to estimate aORs by demographic correlates
(chi-square test of proportions; presented in Table 1). Due to the large sample size
of this study, only p values of <.0001 were considered statistically significant. Chisquare
tests of independence were used to compare the demographic distribution for the
Green Dot across the Bluegrass sample with high school students attending public
schools in Kentucky in the 2009-2010 academic year (Table 2). Furthermore, state and
national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data by demographic attributes were used
to determine how comparable our high school sample was with others using a similar
data collection methodology. Separate logistic regression models were also used to estimate
aORs by sex for sexual harassment victimization and perpetration (Table 3).
Results
Student Response Rates
Approximately 88.1% of all students enrolled in the 26 high schools on the day of the
survey completed a Scantron® form. There were 20,806 students who completed a
Scantron® form and 23,605 students present on survey day at their school. Of those
20,806 completing a Scantron®, 82 were parental refusals (0.4%), 1,454 were student
refusals (7.0%), and an additional 182 students started the survey but completed less
than 30 of the 95 items (partial refusals, 0.9%), for an overall refusal rate of 8.3%.
Another 419 students were excluded from further analyses because they were missing
demographic or other covariate data; and 579 students were excluded because they did
not complete all sexual harassment items. The total analytic sample was 18,090 students,
which was 86.9% of the 20,806 completing a Scantron® form.
Table 1 provides the prevalence rates of any sexual harassment victimization and
perpetration by demographic characteristics. Rates of both victimization and perpetration
were higher among underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) than upperclassmen
(juniors and seniors). Sexual harassment victimization and perpetration differed
significantly by race; victimization was higher among non-White students (33.7%)
compared with White students (29.1%), as was perpetration (11.9% non-White students;
7.8% White students). The majority (86%) of our sample identified themselves
as attracted to the opposite sex only. Students who identified themselves as not exclusively
attracted to the opposite sex had significantly higher rates of victimization
(40.1%) and perpetration (14.2%) relative to those exclusively attracted to the opposite
sex. Almost half (42.4%) of the students who disclosed sexual harassment victimization
answered that they had seen or heard intraparental partner violence. Students
who had witnessed intraparental partner violence also had higher sexual harassment
perpetration rates (13.0%) compared with students who had not observed intraparental
partner violence (6.9%). Students who answered that they were bullied had significantly
higher rates of sexual harassment victimization (57.2% among those bullied
more than twice) and perpetration (17.6%). A similar pattern held for bullying others

bSexual attraction: “People are different in their sexual attraction to other people. Which best describes your feelings?” Responses included only attracted to
females, mostly attracted to females, equally attracted to females and males, mostly attracted to males, only attracted to males, and not sure. A dichotomous variable
was created to determine exclusively heterosexually oriented students based on students’ responses as well as their sex. Those not reporting that they were
attracted only to the opposite sex were grouped as not exclusively heterosexual.
cIntraparental Partner Violence “In your family, how often did you see or hear one of our parents or guardians being hit, slapped, punched, shoved, kicked, or
otherwise physically hurt by their spouse or partner?” Response options ranged from never to more than 10 times but were dichotomized as yes or no.
dBeing bullied: “In the past 12 months, how many times have you been bullied by another high school student?” and bullying others “In the past 12 months,
how many times have you bullied another high school student?” Response options again ranged from never to more than 10 times for both questions.
e Binge drinking: “In the past month, on how many days did you have 4 (if you are a female) or 5 (if you are a male) or more drinks of alcohol in a row (within

and sexual harassment victimization and perpetration. This paradigm supports prior
research literature in terms of the potential overlap of bullying and sexually harassing
behaviors. Students who reported any binge drinking in the past 30 days had higher
rates of sexual harassment victimization (36.6%) and perpetration (14.5%) than those
who did not report binge drinking.
Table 2 presents comparisons of the demographic profiles for the 18,669 high
school students surveyed who answered at least 30 questions in the survey with (a) the
Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) 2009-2010 school year high school population,
(b) the 2009 YRBS data for the Kentucky high school sample, and (c) the
national 2009 YRBS data. Unadjusted chi-square statistics and associated p values
were calculated to compare the demographic distribution of the Green Dot samples
with the three full populations (KDE) or population-based samples (two YRBS
samples).
Female high school students were over-represented (53.5%) in the Green Dot baseline
data relative to those attending public high schools in Kentucky in 2009-2010 (n
= 203,614; 48.6% female) and relative to both the Kentucky 2009 YRBS sample (n =
1,777; 48.7% female) and the national 2009 YRBS sample (n = 16,410; 47.8% female).
Seniors were under-represented in the Green Dot baseline data relative to the KDE
populations as well as the Kentucky YRBS and the national YRBS data. There were
no differences in the proportion of students who were non-White (17.7%) or receiving
a free or reduced price meal (56.2%) in the Green Dot sample relative to the KDE data
(17.5% and 55.0%, respectively). Kentucky YRBS data had fewer non-White students
(14.4%) and, as anticipated, given the racial composition of Kentucky, a significantly
greater proportion of the YRBS national sample was non-White (41.3%).
Among the 18,090 students with no missing data (see Table 3), 29.9% disclosed
experiencing behaviors consistent with sexual harassment victimization. Prevalence
rates, defined as experiencing one of three sexually harassing behaviors at least 3 or
more times in the past 12 months, were almost twice as high among females (37.1%)
than male students (21.4%): aOR = 2.05, p < .0001. A similar pattern of consistently
higher rates among female relative to male students held for each of the three tactics
included in the sexual harassment victimization measure. Prevalence rates of sexual
harassment perpetration were lower (8.5%) than the victimization rates (29.9%).
Furthermore, the sexual harassment perpetration rate among females (5.1%) was
lower than that among males (12.4%). This pattern held for all three tactics with aORs
for females relative to males ranging from .22 to .36 with all aORs being statistically
significant (p < .0001).
The co-occurrence rate of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration
was relatively low; 5.1% of all students reported both, 3.4% perpetration alone,
24.8% reported victimization alone, and two thirds of the students reported neither
sexual harassment victimization nor perpetration. Females were significantly less
likely to report victimization and perpetration (aOR = .60) and perpetration alone
(aOR = .22), but were more likely to report victimization alone (aOR = 2.50) relative
to males. A similar model held for each of the three specific sexual harassment
items.

In summary, perpetration and victimization rates were significantly higher among
underclassmen, non-White students, students who identified as not exclusively
attracted to the opposite sex, those who witnessed parental partner violence, students
who were bullied and who bullied others, and students who reported binge drinking.

Discussion
Prior research in high school settings suggested that sexual harassment was a significant
problem (Hill et al., 2011). One in three female students and one in five male
students completing a survey for our large, cross-sectional study disclosed sexual
harassment victimization. To the best of our knowledge, this was the largest population-based
study to document the prevalence of sexual harassment perpetration. As
anticipated, rates of sexual harassment were significantly lower for perpetration
(8.5%) than for victimization (29.9%). Furthermore, although sexual harassment victimization
rates were higher among females (37.1%) than males (21.4%), the inverse
pattern was observed for perpetration by gender (females 5.1%; males 12.4%).
Because there were no comparable data, we could not infer that our findings were
similar to previously published results. However, we did find that a significant proportion
of students were reporting harassment that had occurred 3 or more times, indicating
that sexual harassment is a chronic problem in high schools.
The findings of this study are consistent with limited research that has found males
more likely to be perpetrators of sexual harassment against females (Fitzgerald et al.,
1999; Stein, 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992). Males were significantly more likely
than females to engage in sexually harassing behaviors, and females were more likely
to report victimization. Similar to our findings, Hill et al. (2011) found that males were
more likely than females to admit they had sexually harassed other students (18%
males vs. 14% females).
Our study found a significantly higher rate of both sexual harassment victimization
and perpetration among those not exclusively attracted to the opposite sex, which is
consistent with reports by Fineran (2001). Students identifying as a sexual minority
are known to be at increased risk of substance abuse and suicide ideation (Russell,
2003; Savin-Williams, 1994). Careful attention should be given to the unique needs of
this potentially vulnerable group of adolescents.
The co-occurrence of both victimization and perpetration of sexual harassment
should be noted. Two studies reported that the majority (80% males and 92% of females)
of students who disclosed that they had sexually harassed another were harassed themselves
(Fineran & Bolen, 2006; Hill et al., 2011). Our findings were similar; of the 8.5%
who disclosed sexual harassment of others, 60.2% were also sexually harassed themselves
(75.8% of females and 52.7% of males who harassed others). These consistent
observations suggest that intervention efforts to target sexual harassment perpetration
likely have benefits for reducing sexual harassment victimization rates, as well as
potentially other forms of interpersonal dating and sexual violence.
Prevention interventions aimed at high school students could improve the consequences
of violence. Prevention interventions with a much younger population are
warranted given that freshman and sophomore students had the highest sexual harassment
victimization and perpetration rates. Furthermore, our observation of high sexual
harassment rates (42.4% sexual harassment victimization and 13.0% perpetration)
among those disclosing intraparental partner violence strongly suggests that patterns
of family violence directly affect children’s aggressive behaviors and their own risk of 
Clear et al. 1215
sexual harassment. Efforts to target aggressive behaviors such as bullying and sexual
harassment that may be on the continuum toward dating and sexual violence could
have an impact in reducing the longer-term mental and physical health consequences
of these more severe forms of gender-based aggression. Clearly, adolescents raised in
homes where partner violence was witnessed (25% of our sample) are an important
focus of intervention attention for early sexual harassment prevention intervention.
Bullying in schools is recognized as an important threat to students’ mental health
and academic achievement. Rates of bullying in this high school population (28.7%
victimization in the past 12 months) were similar to rates of sexual harassment victimization
(29.9%). Students who disclosed being bullied also disclosed sexual harassment.
Similarly, those who bullied others also disclosed sexually harassing others (see
also Pepler et al., 2006). Events to reduce risk of bullying and sexual harassment have
important implications for sexual and dating violence prevention. With an increase in
cyber harassment and other “virtual” ways to sexually harass, new prevention efforts
are needed. This will be difficult, however, in a school environment where school officials
are unaware of or unable to monitor the electronic communications of students.
Strengths and Limitations
The demographic distribution of this sample was comparable with students attending
public high schools in this state; yet, the race distribution differed markedly for the
United States as a whole. To the extent that rates of sexual harassment differed by race,
our rates of sexual harassment may not be representative of rates generalized across
the United States.
As anticipated, females were more likely than males to agree to participate in this
study, which addressed dating and sexual violence. This was possibly due to females
seeing themselves as being at greater risk of gender-based violence. We did observe
higher rates of sexual harassment victimization among females, but higher sexual
harassment perpetration by males. Thus, the gender-specific rates of sexual harassment
are a more accurate reflection of population-based rates given different response
rates by gender.
It is worth noting that we used a somewhat conservative definition of sexual harassment
in that we required that the specific behavior needed to have occurred at least 3
or more times in the past 12 months. Therefore, our sexual harassment rates may be
lower than others using a less restrictive definition.
Conclusion
This was the largest population-based study to provide sexual harassment victimization
and perpetration rates by students’ self-reported sexual attraction, intraparental
partner violence, bullying, and binge drinking. We found that females were more
likely to self-disclose sexual harassment victimization, and males were more likely to
self-report sexual harassment perpetration. Although schools have sexual harassment
policies in place, awareness of what types of behaviors constitute sexual harassment, 
1216 Violence Against Women 20(10)
as well as prevention interventions at earlier ages, could reduce the rates of these negative
behaviors that are affecting so many students.
