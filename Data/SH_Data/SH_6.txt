PEER VICTIMIZATION WITHIN THE ETHNIC CONTEXT OF HIGH SCHOOL




Abstract
Risk for peer victimization varies by ethnicity, but few studies explore how the
ethnic context of the school can affect this. Using a large sample of schools
and high school students, we used hierarchical linear modeling to explore
victimization risk by ethnicity within the ethnic context of the school. Models
predicted total, physical, verbal, and sexual harassment victimization. At the
student level, the model included sex, ethnicity, and the percent of same
ethnicity students at the school. At the school level, the model included
diversity, mean perception of school safety, and mean perception that they
were targeted because of their race/ethnicity. At the student level, having more
same-ethnicity peers, and at the school level, having greater overall diversity,
decreased victimization. Overall, the results support the use of prevention
and intervention efforts targeted at students. C 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Schools are a microcosm of society and can reflect societal attitudes about aggression, race
relations, and diversity. A significant minority of youth is victimized by their peers
because of race, ethnicity, or immigration status (for a review, see Scherr & Larson, 2010),
and the individual and contextual factors that affect this need empirical study to guide
intervention and prevention efforts. However, youth can experience ethnicity-related
victimization from both same and different ethnicity peers (Scherr & Larson). Likewise, if
children mainly associate with same ethnicity peers, they may experience as much or
more general victimization by same-ethnicity peers than by different ethnicity peers.

Prior research has suggested there may be an ‘‘in-group’’ bias, where people
prefer members of their own group compared with those of other groups (Brewer,
1979). This has been applied to studies of ethnicity and peer victimization (e.g., Hanish
& Guerra, 2000a). Young children prefer and have a more positive view of children of
the same ethnicity (e.g., Aboud, 2003), however this tends to dissipate over time as
children become better able to separate the individual from their group identification
(Doyle & Aboud, 1995). Greater intergroup contact, such as having cross-ethnic
friendships, can help reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998), and this is more likely at
schools with greater diversity (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Indeed, when presented with
ambiguous pictures of social situations with minority peers, White children attending
ethnically homogenous schools were more likely to hold negative opinions of the
minority peer and rate friendship as less likely than in a similar study with White
students attending a ethnically diverse school (McGlothlin & Killen, 2006). Thus, the
relation between ethnicity and victimization can be informed by the school context in
which the child develops and socializes. A brief review of ethnicity, peer victimization,
and the school context follows.
Trends in Ethnicity and Peer Victimization
Research on trends in victimization and ethnicity show inconsistent patterns, as various
studies have used different definitions of violence and victimization, measures, and
samples (Felix, Furlong, & Austin, 2009). For example, victimization risk by ethnicity
may depend on the type of victimization (e.g., Finkelhor, Ormrod, Turner, & Hamby,
2005). Other differences may be because of differences between samples and operational
definitions of victimization. For example, one research program finds Latino students at
lowest risk of peer victimization (e.g., Hanish & Guerra, 2000a,b), whereas another finds
Latino students at higher risk than White students, but lower than African American
(e.g., Baker, Mednick, & Carothers, 1989). Consequently, much remains to be known
about the potentially complex relation between ethnicity and peer victimization and this
can be informed by nationally representative and/or population-based studies.
Using a nationally representative survey, Spriggs, Iannotti, Nansel, and Haynie
(2007) found that African Americans had lower rates of bullying victimization (a more
severe subtype of peer victimization based on chronicity and the existence of a power
imbalance) than White and Latino/a youth. This study used a global definition of
bullying, with only one item representing victimization, which means they were unable to
examine ethnic trends in different subtypes of youth victimization. In addition, another
limitation of the extant literature is that most studies of peer victimization or bullying
cannot perform separate analyses on Asian American and Native American students
because of their small sample size. Thus, little is known on their victimization risk.
Prior research using the large, diverse California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS)
dataset began to address some questions on ethnic trends in school victimization
(Felix et al., 2009). The CHKS survey is mandated for schools receiving federal
funds and represents 94% of California schools with enrollment in Grades 7, 9, and 11.
This study found more similarities than differences in rates of victimization across
ethnicities. Ethnic groups were similar in their rank ordering of the most to least
common victimization types. Overall, victimization rates for Asian Americans were
similar or lower than that of the total sample. But, for Native Americans, the rates
were similar or higher, indicating greater risk for victimization. This supports prior
research that highlighted the disproportionately high rates of victimization among
Victimization and Ethnic Context  861
Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop
Native Americans (Stevens, Ruggiero, Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Saunders, 2005).
However, this study did not look at how victimization by ethnicity may be influenced
by the school’s ethnic composition or the percent of same-ethnicity peers within the
school. This is important to understand because victimization targeting an unchangeable
characteristic, like race / ethnicity, can possibly increase risk of feeling helpless or
hopeless, or lower self-esteem (Verkuyten & Thijs, 2006)
Ethnic Context and Peer Victimization
Victimization rates for ethnic groups may depend on the ethnic context of schools.
Prior research has begun to address the ethnic context of peer victimization at the
school or classroom-level among elementary and middle school students (Bellmore,
Witkow, Graham, & Juvonen, 2004; Graham & Juvonen, 2002; Hanish & Guerra,
2000a; Juvonen, Nishina, & Graham, 2006). There are two ways to conceptualize the
ethnic context: at the individual and at the school level. For the individual, having
more students of the same ethnicity may protect against victimization risk (Graham &
Juvonen), but if victimized, may be an additional risk factor for maladjustment
(Bellmore et al.). Ethnic context can also be explored at the classroom or school level,
as the overall ethnic diversity can indicate something about the atmosphere of the
school (e.g., Juvonen et al., 2006). For example, are youth more likely to be victimized
in schools where they were the minority, or the majority?
Percent same ethnicity. Overall, research suggests that ethnic representation within
context may be as or more important than ethnicity itself in predicting victimization
risk and its effects. For example, Hanish and Guerra (2000a) found that victimization
risk was related to ethnicity and school context, in that the diversity (measured as
percent same-ethnicity at the individual-level) of the school had a differential influence
by ethnicity. For African American, White, and Latino students, they calculated the
percent of same ethnicity peers at each of 14 schools. School context moderated the
victimization rates for White and African American students, but did not affect the low
victimization rates of Latino students. For White children, attending ethnically
integrated schools increased their victimization rates, whereas for African American
students it slightly lowered their victimization risk.
Classroom or school ethnic context. Likewise, Graham and Juvonen (2002) argue that the
ethnic composition of a setting can signal an imbalance of power, and consequently
lead to a context for harassment. They suggest that in a diverse school classroom, the
statistical minority might be more vulnerable to victimization, whereas the statistical
majority may be more likely to have reputations as perpetrators, rather than victims.
They had a sample of 418 students (Grades 6 and 7) representing the majority
ethnic groups of Latino and African American, and the minority ethnic groups of
White, Persian or Middle Eastern, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Other (mainly
biracial students). They found that more students from the numerical minority ethnic
groups in the classrooms had reputations as victims, and the numerical majority ethnic
groups had more students with reputations as aggressors. Knowing that victimization
risk by ethnicity varied by how ethnically integrated the school context was
862  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011
Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop
underscores the need for more research examining the nested nature of student
victimization data.
It remains to be seen if the overall ethnic diversity of a context creates an
atmosphere that discourages ethnic harassment. On one hand, Juvonen, Nishina, and
Graham (2006) found that greater ethnic diversity in the classroom was associated with
lower levels of perceived victimization, less loneliness, and greater perceptions of
school safety. However, in a study of peer racial discrimination in the Netherlands,
Verkuyten and Thijs (2002) did not find that diversity of the classroom or the
percentage of Dutch pupils compared with ethnic minority children influenced rates
of racial discrimination.
Ethnic minority children were still more likely to report experiencing racist namecalling
and social exclusion because of their ethnic background than Dutch children.
It was being in a classroom environment where teachers reacted to ethnic harassment
that reduced victimization. In our study, we explore variables that indicate peer
victimization in general (i.e., physical, verbal, and sexual harassment) as well as include a
variable representing possible ethnic discrimination (harassed or bullied because of race/
ethnicity). This allows us to ascertain how each may be influenced by ethnic context.
Current Study
Prior research demonstrates that the relation between ethnicity, ethnic context, and
victimization is complex and that more research with larger sample sizes and a greater
number of schools is needed to help elucidate trends. Whereas prior studies used
middle or elementary school samples, our study extends the inquiry to students in
high school. This study also uses self-report instead of peer nomination methods of
assessing victimization, has a larger sample of schools, has a more detailed measure of
peer victimization than some prior research (e.g., Hanish & Guerra, 2000a), and can
include under-represented ethnic groups, such as Native American and Asian
American students. We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to address the
individual (gender, ethnicity, percent same ethnicity at the school) and school level
(diversity, mean perception of school safety, and mean perception that victimization is
because of race or ethnicity) factors that affect victimization. Perception of school safety
is included because it is a correlate of peer victimization (Felix et al., 2009) and an
indicator of the atmosphere of the school. We examine this for total victimization as
well as the specific subtypes of physical, verbal, and sexual harassment victimization to
determine if patterns are consistent across victimization subtypes. This will allow for
greater understanding of how school ethnic context influences risk for various forms
of peer victimization.
First, we explore general trends in peer victimization by student demographic
characteristics to better understand our sample. Then, we hypothesize that having
more same ethnicity peers would reduce student victimization risk. This is based on
some support from prior research (e.g., Graham & Juvonen, 2002) and from the
theoretical argument that victimization is possibly greatest when children are in the
ethnic group with least representation at school, which has guided past studies (e.g.,
Graham & Juvonen; Hanish & Guerra, 2000a). Second, we examine the school context
factors that influence victimization risk. We focus on the school characteristics that may
be responsible for variation in victimization among schools, such as the school’s level of
diversity, overall perception of school safety, and mean of students’ perception that
they are targeted for harassment or bullying because of their race/ethnicity. These
Victimization and Ethnic Context  863
Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop
three variables were chosen because they indicate something about the overall
atmosphere of a given school. We hypothesized that greater school level diversity and
safety would be related to lower levels of victimization across the different types
assessed. For diversity, although the research base does not provide clear direction,
this is based on the ideas that greater diversity may represent a balance of power
between ethnic groups. If an ethnic group is a very small percentage of the student
population (i.e., less than 10%), they may be at greater risk of victimization because of
lack of power and more limited opportunity for intergroup contact that leads to crossethnic
friendship (at least for the majority group). We also expected that less school
level harassment or bullying based on race or ethnicity (a possible indicator of ethnic
discrimination) would be related to less victimization.
METHOD
Participants
We used the 2004–2005 academic year CHKS data sample. The original 2004–2005
CHKS dataset represents approximately 94% of California’s schools with enrollment
for Grades 7, 9, and 11, including students at nontraditional, alternative, and
continuation schools. To be included in the survey, schools had to obtain consent from
at least 65% of their students; districts varied on the use of active or passive consent
procedures. Only students who passed validity criteria (99%) were retained. Students
were excluded for inconsistent patterns of responding, implausible reports of drug
use, the endorsement of a fictitious drug, or failure to assent to having answered
survey questions honestly. We selected the Grade 9 and Grade 11 students to examine
high school students’ victimization. We focus on high school students only, because this
age group has not been addressed in prior research. This CHKS sample is different
from our prior research with the CHKS (e.g., Felix et al., 2009), in that it uses data
collected in a different year and uses only high school students. We also explore the
role of ethnicity in greater detail than in our prior work.
Sample
The sample included 161,838 eligible Grade 9 and Grade 11 students attending
528 schools. There were slightly more females (52.6%) than males (47.4%). The ethnic
groups represented include Native American (1.2%), Asian/Pacific Islander (7.5%),
African American (4.5%), Hispanic (38.1%), White (30.5%), and Other (18.2%).
Measures
The CHKS is a set of modules developed by WestEd’s Human Development Program
in collaboration with Duerr Evaluation Resources for the California Department of
Education California. The CHKS collects ongoing youth health and risk behavior data
as part of the No Child Left Behind Act. Items for the measures were taken from the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the
California Student Survey (WestEd). In California, the CHKS is mandated statewide
and is administered biannually at each school that receives public funding. The CHKS
was carefully developed having undergone more than 10 years of rigorous
development and review by a standing panel of independent experts.

Student-Level Variables
Demographics. The demographic characteristics of sex, grade, and ethnicity were
included in the hierarchical model predicting victimization.
Victimization. A list of the victimization items used in this study to create the total
victimization score is provided in Table 1. Items specify that the victimization occurred
on school property and response options ranged from 1–4 were ‘‘0 times,’’ ‘‘1 time,’’ ‘‘2
to 3 times,’’ and ‘‘4 or more times.’’ The item on ‘‘been afraid of being beaten up at
school’’ is not behavioral like the other forms of victimization, but reflects exposure
victimization, which also can negatively affect student well-being. For physical
victimization, we summed the following items: ‘‘been pushed, shoved, slapped, hit,
kicked, etc’’, ‘‘been afraid of being beaten up,’’ and ‘‘been threatened with a weapon.’’
For sexual harassment, we used the item assessing experiencing ‘‘unwanted sexual jokes,
comments or gestures.’’ For verbal victimization, we summed the items of ‘‘had rumors
or lies spread about you’’ and ‘‘been made fun of because of the way you look or talk.’’
We use total, physical, sexual harassment, and verbal victimization at the individual
level. For HLM, the scores were continuous variables, whereas for Table 1 only they
were dichotomized for descriptive purposes.
Percent same ethnicity. For each student, we identified the number of other students
who shared same ethnicity and divided that number by the total number of students in
the school.
School level Variables
Perceptions of victimization because of race/ethnicity. For this item, participants were
presented a definition of bullying, which specifically stated it is not bullying when
students of about the same strength quarrel or fight. Students were then asked,
‘‘During the past 12 months, how many times on school property were you harassed or
bullied for any of the following reasons?’’ Reasons included race/ethnicity as well as
other demographic characteristics. We used only the item related to race/ethnicity in
this study and it has the same response scale as the victimization items. We use the
mean level of perceived victimization because of race/ethnicity at the school level.
School safety. This was assessed with the item ‘‘How safe do you feel when you are at
school?’’ Response options ranged on a 5-point scale, from 1 (very safe) to 5 (very
unsafe). We took the mean level of this at the school level.
School diversity. This was computed using the following formula (Simpson, 1949):
DC ¼ 1 X
g
i¼1
p2
i ;
where DC is the ethnic diversity of a given school and p is the proportion of students in
the school who are in ethnic group i. Then, p2
i is summed across g groups in a school.
Referred to as Simpson’s index of diversity, this index measures the probability that

any two students randomly selected in a school are from different ethnic groups. It
ranges from 0 to 1.00, with values closer to 1.00 indicating greater diversity.
Analysis
We developed two-level HLMs to test our hypotheses concerning both individual-level
and school-level predictors. HLM allows for modeling the hierarchical relationships
(i.e., the nesting of students within schools). This analysis strategy helps us avoid
problems including underestimating standard errors that are smaller than they should
be. First, we tested the null model, which contained only the outcome variable of
victimization without any individual-level or school-level explanatory variables. The
null model is useful to examine the proportion of variance in the outcome variables
arising from different levels (i.e., student level and school level) by partitioning the
outcome variance among the nested units. To explain the variation at the student level,
we considered various individual characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, and percent
same ethnicity within the school. Next, we developed the level two (school level)
model. We expanded on the second step by adding school level factors (diversity, mean
perception of school safety, and mean perception that victimization is because of race
or ethnicity) to the level two model to explain the variance associated with school
context. Finally, significant coefficients associated with student’s ethnicity were
modeled by percent same ethnicity at the school level.
RESULTS
Demographic Trends in Victimization
Preliminary analysis of demographic trends was conducted to provide context for
subsequent analysis and interpretation of results. Descriptive statistics are provided in
Table 1. For this table only, we dichotomized the various victimization experiences (no
victimization versus any victimization) to represent ever having been victimized in that
way during the past 12 months and ran frequencies across grade, sex, and ethnicity.
Given the large sample size, there is the problem of all measures of association being
statistically significant, therefore, as with our prior research (e.g., Felix et al., 2009), we
interpret only differences that were also at least five percentage points. In our high
school sample, physical victimization decreased with grade, however other forms of
victimization remained similar. Native Americans had higher rates of physical
victimization than all other ethnicities. They also had higher rates of property being
stolen and having been threatened or injured with a weapon than most other ethnic
groups, except African American students, who had the second highest ranking on
these variables. Asian/ Pacific Islander students had the lower rates of sexual
harassment than all other ethnicities. Hispanic students were lower on sexual
harassment victimization than White or African American students.
Means, standard deviations, and ranges for all variables used in this study are
presented in Table 2. The means for each type of victimization are on the low end,
indicating there are many students who reported no or infrequent victimization, which
is consistent with much of peer victimization research and our past research using the
CHKS. Differences in means were examined by ethnicity, with only po.01 considered
significant because of the large sample size (see Table 2). Demographic trends were
Victimization and Ethnic Context  867
Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop
generally consistent with the results from Table 1. The means for school level diversity
were consistent with prior research (Bellmore et al., 2004; Juvonen et al., 2006).
The means for percent same ethnicity were a little different than those found by
Hanish and Guerra (2000a), but it is understandable given that our sample is from a
different region in the United States. The distribution of scores on percent same
ethnicity ranged from 0 to 100, such that any particular ethnic group comprised
between 0% and 100% of the school populations. Ranges by ethnicity were 0% for
Native Americans, 0%–83% (mean [M] 5 24.96%, standard deviation [SD] 5 21.60%)
for Asian Americans, 0%–87% (M 5 11.25%, SD 5 9.65%) for African Americans,
0%–95% (M 5 52.54%, SD 5 20.89%) for Whites, and 2%–100% (M 5 63.37%,
SD 5 24.22%) for Hispanics.
We conducted HLM to assess individual and school predictors of victimization
experience by ethnicity and ethnic context of the school. First, a null model was applied
to the data. This null model allowed us to partition the total variance in overall
victimization into within-school and between-school variances. Most of the variability lay
within school among students (97%). Yet the chi-square test statistic of between-school
variability revealed that statistically significant variability existed between schools in
students’ average victimization scores. Therefore, even though the intra-class correlation
(3%) was not high, we proceeded with the HLM at both student and school levels to
adequately account for aspects of school context. The HLM accounted for 48.5–50% of
the between-school variance in total victimization and subtypes of victimization.

Results of HLMs on total and subtypes of victimization score are shown in Table 3.
The effect sizes are also provided for comparing the relative influence of different
predictors from student and school level. According to Cohen’s (1988) guidelines,
effect sizes of 0.1 and 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.5, and 0.5 or more are defined as small,
medium, and large, respectively.
Gender and ethnicity factors showed relatively small to large effects on the
students’ victimization experiences. Boys reported lower rates of total, verbal, and
sexual harassment victimization than did girls, but had higher rates of physical
victimization. Asian Pacific Islanders were less victimized compared with their White
peers across victimization types, but especially for sexual harassment. Hispanic
students were also lower, with the exception of physical victimization, where there was
no difference. The effect size was medium for sexual harassment for Hispanic
students, which was the largest for them across victimization types. Native American
students experienced more physical victimization compared with their White peers,
but had lower rates of verbal and sexual harassment victimization.
Percent Same Ethnicity and Victimization Risk
As seen in Table 3, effect sizes (ranged from .12 to .21) indicated that there were
significant, but relatively small effects of percent same ethnicity in the school on
adolescents’ peer victimization experience. When more peers shared their ethnicity,
students were less victimized.
School Context and Victimization Risk
The effects of school level predictors on peer victimization are shown in the bottom of
Table 3. Mean perception of being targeted for bullying because of race or ethnicity
was the strongest predictor of student total victimization risk. Specifically, it had large
effects on total victimization (effect size [ES] 5 .66), sexual harassment (ES 5 .70), and

verbal victimization (ES 5 .82). We subsequently explored different ethnic groups’
perceptions of being harassed or bullied because of race or ethnicity. A one-way
between groups analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact of ethnicity
on perceived victimization because of race/ethnicity. There was a statistically significant
difference at the po.05 level, F(4,128,902) 5 382.37, in perceived victimization
because of race/ethnicity for the five ethnic groups. Asian Pacific Islanders
(M 5 1.49, SD 5 .93) had highest scores among five ethnic groups, followed by African
American students (M 5 1.44, SD 5 .91). Native American, Hispanic, and White
students reported significantly less victimization because of race/ethnicity than Asian
Pacific Islanders and African American students.
Interestingly, for sexual harassment victimization, neither the level of diversity at
the school nor the perceptions of school safety affected risk for being sexually
harassed. School diversity decreased risk of victimization for total, physical, and verbal
victimization (ES 5 .17 to .45, practically small to medium effects). There was not a
relation between school diversity and sexual harassment. Mean perception of school
safety negatively affected the risk of physical victimization.
DISCUSSION
Within the school context, youth learn from their peers, teachers, and other adults
about acceptable behavior, how to handle conflict, ways to assert, manage, or limit
power and control within relationships, and appropriate social behavior. At times, this
behavior can be influenced by an ‘‘in-group bias’’ (Brewer, 1979), where preference is
for peers similar to oneself. As peer victimization is a problem within every school, it is
something that students and the adults in their lives learn to avoid, resolve, or endure.
Sometimes, peer victimization, such as teasing, is used as social control to shape a
person’s behavior into what is considered the social norm, such as the sexual
harassment of boys not perceived as masculine enough by their male peers (McMaster,
Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2002). However, peer victimization can also target individual
characteristics that are unchangeable, such as race/ethnicity, and can reflect negative
societal attitudes about a particular group, which can also be a result of in-group bias
(Brewer). Victimization targeting unchangeable personal characteristics arguably can
increase risk of feeling helpless or hopeless, or lower self-esteem (Verkuyten & Thijs,
2006), perhaps because of self-blaming attributions (Bellmore et al., 2004).
This study focused on risk of peer victimization by ethnicity within the ethnic
context of the school. We used hierarchical linear modeling to address the student
(gender, ethnicity, percent same ethnicity at the school) and school level (diversity,
mean perception of school safety, and mean perception that victimization is because of
race or ethnicity) factors that affect victimization. We examined this for total
victimization as well as the specific subtypes of physical, verbal, and sexual harassment
victimization to determine if patterns are consistent across victimization subtypes. Our
study yielded results that further illuminate how ethnicity and school context influence
victimization risk.
Demographic Trends in Victimization
Victimization rates were examined by grade, gender, and ethnicity in Table 1. In our
high school sample, physical victimization tended to decrease with age, which is
consistent with school bullying research (Olweus, 1994). As expected based on prior
870  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011
Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop
research (American Association of University Women [AAUW], 2001), sexual
harassment victimization was the most common form of victimization in this older
sample of youth. Our other gender-related findings also support extant research (e.g.,
Olweus; AAUW, 2001), including that female students reported higher rates of verbal
and sexual harassment victimization and males had higher physical victimization.
In terms of ethnicity, when examining simple frequencies, we found that Native
American students had higher rates of physical victimization than all other ethnicities.
They also were more likely to have property stolen or been threatened or injured with
a weapon than all other groups, except African Americans, who were second highest.
One possible explanation is that Native Americans are often a numerical minority at
schools, which may increase victimization risk. Likewise, outside of the major urban
centers of California, African American students are also often a minority in schools.
Also, in the United States, African American and Native Americans have historically
experienced more systematic, widespread societal oppression and racism than other
ethnic groups (not to say that other ethnic groups have not also experienced
prejudice). This may still be manifested in terms of more frequent prejudice and
stereotyping that can increase risk of victimization.
When rates of victimization by ethnicity were explored collectively using HLM,
small to large effects were found. With Whites as the comparison group, Asian/Pacific
Islander students reported significant lower rates of victimization than White students
across the total and different subtypes of victimization assessed, especially for sexual
harassment. Hispanic students also showed significantly lower rates than White students,
with the exception of physical victimization, in which there was no difference. Among
elementary school students, Hanish and Guerra (2000a) also found that Hispanic
students reported significantly less victimization than White students. In the Hanish and
Guerra (2000a) study, as with much of prior research, Asian/Pacific Islander students
were not studied separately because of small sample size, thus our findings on their low
victimization rates fill a gap in the research. In our study, Asian/Pacific Islander and
African American students were significantly more likely than the other ethnicities to
report that they perceived they were harassed or bullied because of their race/ethnicity.
Another understudied group of youth were those who identify as Native
American. With Whites as the comparison group, Native American students show
significantly higher physical victimization risk, which was consistent with prior
research (Stevens et al., 2005). However, they had lower verbal and sexual harassment
victimization. As research on peer victimization among Native Americans is scant,
there is not empirical guidance as to why their victimization was higher for physical,
but not verbal subtypes. This is an area for future research.
Percent Same Ethnicity and Victimization Risk
Given disproportionately high rates of victimization for some groups of students, it was
important to understand what contextual factors reduce risk. Having a greater
number of students of the same ethnicity reduced victimization, across all types
assessed. Graham and Juvonen (2002) point out that this increases the ethnic group’s
power (in the numerical sense) at the school, which can reduce victimization.
Verkuyten and Thijs (2002) argue that measuring ethnic composition of a classroom or
school matters because the percent of same ethnicity peers may determine experience
and attitudes. Specifically, they suggested that the greater the proportion of same
ethnicity peers, the more the child was protected from prejudice and discrimination;
Victimization and Ethnic Context  871

whereas when it was lower, discrimination may increase and there may be less social
support to help a student cope.
School Context and Victimization Risk
Prior research has shown that ethnic representation within the school context matters
when examining victimization risk and the mental health consequences of victimization
(Graham & Juvonen, 2002). Our model of the school context included mean
school safety, diversity, and perceiving that you were targeted because of your race/
ethnicity. Our study explored factors related to victimization risk at the individual and
school level. Consistent with prior research on a younger sample (Hanish & Guerra,
2000a), we found that among high school students victimization risk was related to
ethnicity and school context. Most variation was found at the student, not school, level.
This finding is consistent with prior work that found that most of the variability lay
between individuals when it comes to students’ nonacademic behavioral experiences
(Ma, 2003; You, 2005). This supports the use of interventions targeted at students,
such as much of the content of current violence prevention, conflict resolution, or
other social-emotional prevention curriculum.
Diversity. We found that greater diversity decreased victimization risk overall and across
most subtypes. The exception was sexual harassment. Diversity may decrease peer
victimization through its ability to reduce in-group bias and prejudice, which may be
one cause of some forms of peer victimization. Intergroup contact theory (Allport,
1954; Pettigrew, 1998) has been used to explain how contact between different racial
or ethnic groups can reduce prejudice. Allport described four conditions for the
intergroup contact to be beneficial in reducing prejudice: equal group status within the
situation, common goals, intergroup cooperation, and authority support. Friendship
between members of different ethnic groups can lead to all four conditions being met.
At schools with greater diversity, there is increased probability of intergroup contact
(Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), which increases the chance of cross-ethnic friendships. This
may lead to changes in stereotypes and behaviors (Pettigrew), which can reduce crossethnic
peer victimization or ethnic discrimination.
Victimization because of race/ethnicity. Prior research suggested that when students
perceived they were being victimized by peers because of their race/ethnicity, they tended
to interpret this as discrimination (Verkuyten, Kinket & Van der Wielen, 1997). Among
the school level variables included in this study, we found that mean perception of being
targeted for bullying because of race or ethnicity was the strongest predictor of student
total victimization risk, and each subtype of victimization. It had large effect sizes for verbal
(ES 5 .82) and sexual harassment (ES 5 .70) victimization, and medium for physical
victimization (ES 5 .37). It is likely that it is more apparent that an action is because of the
race/ethnicity of the recipient for verbal types of aggression. Verkuyten and Thijs (2002)
contend that children are more likely to say they have seen their same-ethnicity peers
targeted for racist name-calling and social exclusion than to have experienced it
themselves. Thus, it may affect school climate. It is important to note that they also found
that in classrooms where children saw teachers discipline ethnic harassment there was less
harassment or bullying because of race.
Perception of school safety. The overall perception of school safety at different school sites
may be another contextual factor associated with victimization risk. Our results indicated
872  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011
Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop
that overall school safety affected risk of physical victimization. However, verbal
victimization was unrelated to overall school safety. It could be because of the questions
asked, ‘‘had rumors or lies spread about you’’ and ‘‘been made fun of because of the way
you look or talk,’’ which can often occur between friends. Students may greatly dislike
experiencing these behaviors, and may avoid school or people because of embarrassment,
but they may not necessarily experience fear. Verbal victimization affects the
quality of the school environment, but by itself may not lead to feeling unsafe.
Strengths and Limitations
Prior research has examined victimization risk within the ethnic context of the school,
but a strength of this study was extending the inquiry to high school youth. This study
also benefited from a large group of students and schools to help with generalizability of
our findings. Because of the large sample size, this study was able to fill in gaps in
peer victimization research on Native American and Asian/Pacific Islander students.
We used HLM, which accounted for variance at the student and school level, and this
strengthened our findings. Finally, this study assessed the model across different types
of victimization, whereas previous research tended to look at overall victimization.
One limitation was that this study was solely self-report, and students can vary in
their propensity to believe they were victimized because of their race/ethnicity or
whether behaviors were unwanted and hurtful. In addition, although intergroup
contact theory may explain why school diversity can reduce victimization risk, the
CHKS survey does not directly assess the components of the theory, such as equal
status within groups and cross-ethnic contact and friendships. Finally, this study was
cross-sectional, so direction of causality cannot be determined.
Conclusion
Overall, we found support that the ethnic context matters when looking at
victimization risk. Most of the variation in victimization risk can be explained at the
student level. At the student level, having more same ethnicity peers reduced
victimization risk. At the school level, diversity and mean perception of being targeted
for bullying because of race or ethnicity were related to most victimization types.
However, like at the student level, diversity was a factor in reducing risk for many
forms of victimization at the school level. School diversity can increase probability of
cross-ethnic friendships that can reduce prejudice and stereotyping (Pettigrew &
Tropp, 2006). Regardless of the balance of power between ethnic groups within a
given school, students benefit from an environment where teachers and staff actively
address peer victimization and harassment in all its forms (Olweus, 1994; Verkuyten &
Thijs, 2002). This will lead to safer schools for all students.
