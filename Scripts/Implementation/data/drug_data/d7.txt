1. Introduction
Initiation of substance use at an early age is a significant predictor for later substance abuse and delinquent behaviors (Halfors et al., 2002). Drug use during adolescence typically continues into adult- hood (Arteaga, Chen, & Reynolds, 2010). Substance use is increasing among Taiwan youth (Gau, Chong, Chen, & Cheng, 2005). High prevalence of substance use disorders was found among adolescent students in Taiwan with psychiatric comorbid conditions similar to those in Western countries (Chong, Chan, & Cheng, 1999). Illicit drug use prevalence was 6.4% among adolescent students in Taiwan,

abstract
This epidemiological study aimed to investigate illicit drug use by vocational high school night-class students in Taiwan to identify hypothesized proximal and distal factors associated with drug use patterns. Between September 2010 and January 2011, a randomized sample was drawn from 33 vocational high school night classes, enrolling 1079 students already employed outside campus. Subjects completed a validated self- reported questionnaire measuring proximal factors (biological, psychological, and behavioral) and distal factors (living with parents, parents' or siblings' use of legal substances, supervision by primary guardian, and perceived peer influence on drug use). Age, greater sensation-seeking behavior and legal substances use (i.e., tobacco and betel nuts) increased odds of being identified as experimental or regular users versus non-drug users. Higher rates of rule-breaking behavior were associated with increased odds of being identi- fied as experimental users versus non-drug users. Among distal factors, only perceived peer influence on drug use was significantly associated with experimental and regular drug use. Proximal and distal factors were associated with drug use patterns among vocational high school night-class students. Influence factors iden- tified may help vocational high school officials design effective illicit drug intervention programs for students with different drug use patterns.

and a dose/response relationship was found between drinking (prev- alence 70.7%), tobacco smoking (prevalence 56%) illicit drug use and exposure to other risk factors (Yang, Yand, Liu, & Ko, 1998).
The present study focused on the under-investigated, at-risk pop- ulation of vocational high school night class students, many of whom are employed in work-study programs off campus. Among adolescent students working part time while in school, 25% smoked cigarettes and 30% drank alcohol; estimates of illicit drug use and heavy illicit drug use were 16.7% and 1.8%, respectively, and accessibility of legal sub- stances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, betel nuts) and illicit drugs (e.g., ketamine, cannabis, heroin) was higher in the work environment (Wu, Schlenger, & Galvin, 2003). The work and job training environment outside school communicates a norm for smoking and drinking, making it more likely that students exposed to this pro-substance use environment will en- counter illicit drugs than regular high school students. This study aimed

to determine the relative influence of proximal and distal factors in specif- ic drug use patterns. Our study results may help develop effective preven- tive approaches to meet the needs of adolescents with different drug use patterns.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
A population-based sample was drawn from 377 vocational high school night classes with combined enrollment of 14,575 students in northern Taiwan. The 377 night classes of 17 vocational high schools randomly selected a number from an envelope containing numbers 1 to 377; 10% of classes (n=37) were randomly selected to participate in the survey. Finally, 33 classes agreed to participate, yielding a sample of 1 120 students. All students from selected night classes (range, 17–50 students per class) were invited by letter to participate. A total of 1079 students (96.34%) agreed to participate and complete the survey and, before beginning, all students and parents/guardians provided signed informed consent but no names was marked on questionnaires to ensure confidentiality. The ques- tionnaire took approximately 30 minutes to complete. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Yang-Ming University.
2.2. Measures
Correlates related to drug use patterns were divided into proximal and distal factors. Proximal factors comprised biological, psychological, and behavioral factors. The biological factors included age and gender. The psychological factor was measured by a short sensation-seeking scale (BSSS-8) comprising sensation seeking: thrill and adventure seeking, experience seeking, disinhibition and boredom susceptibility (Palmgreen, Donohew, Lorch, Hoyle, & Stephenson, 2001; Stephenson, Velez, Chalela, Ramirez, & Hoyle, 2007). Behavioral factors included students' self-reported use of legal substances (i.e., tobacco, alcohol, and betel nuts), rule-breaking behavior, and extent of missing classes. Distal factors included: living with both parents, legal substances use by parent(s) or sibling(s), supervision by primary guardian (five items) (Bahr, Hoffmann, & Yang, 2005; Martins, Storr, Alexandre, & Chilcoat, 2008; Wang, Matthew, Bellamy, & James, 2005), and perceived peer influence to use illicit drugs (11 items) (Korhonen et al., 2008; Lundborg, 2006; Romer & Hennessy, 2007). Participants were classified into three groups based on drug use patterns: non-drug users, experi- mental users (tried drugs once and/or used drugs occasionally), and regular users (used drugs in established patterns, regularly/frequently). Experimental use refers to short-term, non-patterned use typically motivated by curiosity and regular use refers to an established pattern of frequent use (Connell, Gilreath, Aklin, & Brex, 2010).
2.3. Validity of the instrument
A pilot test of the original instrument was conducted with 60 students from two representative vocational high school night classes. Content validity and readability analyses were conducted. Based on pilot test results, the instrument was slightly revised. Coef- ficients of test-retest reliability were greater than or equal to 0.80 among all factors. Factor analysis was done for each of 3 multi-item scales. Sensation seeking (proximal factor), supervision by primary guardian (distal factor) and peer influence on drug use (distal factors) on each scale accounted for 63.82%, 55.70% to 66.90% of variance, respectively. Estimates of reliability were calculated using Cronbach's alpha; all 3 measures were greater than or equal to 0.80.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 statistics soft- ware (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data are expressed as mean with standard deviation (mean±SD) and categorical data as n (%). To evaluate associations, one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni adjustment approach was applied for comparisons of continuous var- iables and Pearson Chi-square test for comparisons of categorical var- iables. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify proximal and distal influence factors relative to user groups (non-drug users, experimental users, regular users). All parameters significantly associated with drug use patterns were then put into multinomial logistic regression analysis. All statistical assessments were considered significant at p b 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic characteristics and drug use behavior
Among 1079 students, 881 (81.7%) were non-drug users, 147 (13.6%) were experimental users and 51 (4.7%) were regular users; 648 (60.1%) were males (mean age 17.5 years; SD=1.6). A total of 672(62.3%)students were living with both parents.
3.2. Dispersion of students' proximal and distal influencing factors be- tween three groups
All proximal factors (biological factors, psychological factor, and be- havioral factors) were significantly higher in experimental users and regular users compared with the non-drug-users (all P b 0.001), except for gender. For psychological factor, sensation seeking scores were higher in students with more regular drug use (regular users > experimental users > non-drug-users). Percentages of tobacco use (30.1%), alcohol use (34.2%), betel nut use (10.3%), rule-breaking behavior (59.6%), and miss- ing classes (58.3%) were significantly lower among non-drug users than among experimental users (44.9–91.2%) or regular users (58.8–90.2%) (Table 1).
Among distal factors, the percentage of non-drug users whose sib- ling(s) had used legal substances (35.3%) was significantly lower than that of experimental users (59.9%) or regular users (56.9%). More frequent drug use correlated with higher scores in peer influence on drug use (regular users 25.39 > experimental users 20.58 > non-drug users 13.34). Supervision by primary guardian was lower in the drug user groups (13.16-13.82) than in the non-drug user group (15.47) (Table 1).
3.3. Factors associated with regularity of drug use
All proximal and distal influence factors were analyzed, except for living with both parents and legal substances use by parents, which showed no significant differences among the three groups. Within proximal factors, after controlling for other factors, older students were at increased odds for being identified as regular users compared to non-drug users (Table 2). Greater sensation seeking was associated with increased odds for being identified as experimental users or regular users versus non-drug users. Regularity of drug use was asso- ciated with several behavioral factors, especially legal substances use (i.e., tobacco and betel nuts) (Table 2). Higher levels of tobacco use and betel nut use increased odds of being identified as experimental users or regular users versus non-drug users. Higher rates of rule- breaking behavior were associated with increased odds of being iden- tified as experimental users than as non-drug users (Table 2). Among distal factors, only peer influence on drug use was associated with significant differentiation between non-drug users and experimental users and regular users. Higher perceived peer influence on drug use was associated with increased odds of being identified as experimental

users and regular users than as non-drug users. Overall accuracy of the final prediction model is 86.7% (Table 2).
4. Discussion
Our results strongly support the hypothesis that proximal and dis- tal factors affect vocational high school night-class students on the drug use patterns, which is classified as non-drug users, experimental users and regular users. Proximal factors producing larger effects than distal factors on classifying and differentiating drug use patterns. Legal addictive substances use (tobacco and betel nuts) had the sig- nificant effects on the drug use patterns. Among distal factors, per- ceived peer influence on using drugs was closely associated with drug use patterns but supervision by primary guardian was not.
Lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use by vocational school students in Taiwan was 2.3–2.7% (Chen, 2005; Chou, Ho, Chen, & Chen, 2006). In this study, lifetime prevalence was 18.3% and differ- ences may be due to investigating only vocational high school night-class students. Unlike full-time high school students, most vocational high school night-class students work days, making them both student and employee. In addition, about 50% of learning time is spent in workplace training. Those features made them affordable to buy substances (Mortimer, Finch, Ryu, Shanahan, & Call, 1996) and higher chance to be exposed to a pro-substance use environment (Wu et al., 2003).
We found the largest effects on class membership were by legal use of tobacco, alcohol, and betel nuts. Unlike reports of Western cultures showing strong associations between alcohol use and drug use (Poorasl, Vahidi, Fakhari, Rostami, & Dastghiri, 2007), our findings revealed a culture-specific phenomenon, pointing to the strong effects of tobacco use on class membership closely followed by betel nuts, while alcohol had no significant effect on drug use. Lifetime prevalence of betel nut use among high school students (3.3–7.3%) was previously reported to be lower than that of tobacco (17.8– 25.8%) or alcohol use (42.1–43.1%) (Chen et al., 2009). However, after adjusting for other factors, we observed a significant association between betel nuts chewing and illicit drug use, suggesting important implications of betel nuts chewing for illicit drug prevention and intervention. Psychological factor such as sensation seeking tenden- cies also closely associated with illicit drug use, which was similar to the findings of other studies (Martins et al., 2008; Yanovitzky, 2005).
Among distal factors, peer influence had better predictive ability than family influence among vocational high school night-class stu- dents, especially for distinguishing experimental and regular users from non-drug users. While the influence of family factors decreases with time, the influence of peer factors increases with time (Guo, Hill, Hawkins, Catalano, & Abbott, 2002).
Limitations of this study include use of a single specific sample population, limiting generalizability of study findings. Also, data were only self reported and no drug testing was done, which could influence interpretation of results. However, evidence suggests that adolescent self-reports are reliable, valid, and do not usually result in systematic reporting bias (Needle, McCubbin, Lorence, & Hochhauser, 1983).
