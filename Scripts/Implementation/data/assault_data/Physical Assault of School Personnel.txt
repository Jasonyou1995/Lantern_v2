Physical Assault of School Personnel



AbstractPhysical assault against school personnel is a serious problem, although not highly publicized. This workplace violence can result in debilitating injury to school employees along with major monetary costs. This article looks at legal issues that address physical assault against school personnel as well as the roles professional associations have taken in support of school personnel. Recommended school district policies along with campus practices for minimizing workplace violence, especially physical assault against school employees, are provided.Violence against school personnel is a serious problem in the United States. In fact, violence against classroom teachers has been termed “a silent national crisis” (American Psychological Association 2013American Psychological Association. 2013. Violence against teachers: A silent national crisis.http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/activities/violence-against.aspx. [Google Scholar], 1). Annually, 7 percent of school teachers who work in the United States are victims of some type of violent act; for example, physical assault (Novotney 2009Novotney, Amy. 2009. Little-known victims. Monitor on Psychology 40(9): 68.http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/teacher-victim.aspx. [Google Scholar], 1). Feda (2008Feda, Denise. 2008. Written violence policies and assault deterrents in Minnesota schools: Impact on educators’ risk of physical assault. PhD diss., University of Minnesota. ProQuest (AAT 3295685).http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1456297021&Fmt=2&clientId=105&RQT=309&VName=PQD. , 1) found that the annual rate of physical assault against Minnesota educators was at 8.3 percent. Tiesman (2008Tiesman, Hope. 2008. Violence against teachers and school staff. NIOSH Science Blog, July 18.http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2008/04/teacher/. [Google Scholar], 1) purported that the percentage of aggressive acts against teachers is perhaps higher because numerous incidents are not reported.Not only classroom teachers but also other school personnel are victims of school violence. These other school employees can include administrators, secretaries, classroom aides, substitute teachers, student teachers, school board members, law enforcement officers, food service employees, custodial staff, bus drivers, school crossing attendees, contractors, and volunteers (The South Carolina Education Association 2010, 1). The outcomes of school violence, especially physical assault, can result in physical and emotional injuries as well as financial costs for the employees who have been victimized; moreover, these acts of violence can also impact assailants, employers, and taxpayers (American Psychological Association 2013American Psychological Association. 2013. Violence against teachers: A silent national crisis.http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/activities/violence-against.aspx. [Google Scholar], 1).In the United States many states have passed statutes in an attempt to deter and prevent physical assaults against school personnel and to provide protection for school employees. Moreover, state and national groups (e.g., teacher associations) are prepared to take legal action to support school personnel who have been victimized while on duty. School district policies and procedures should provide guidance that constitutes a sound approach to serving students educationally, while protecting the safety of school personnel and minimizing potential financial losses and employee absence and attrition. Policies and procedures addressing key elements should be included in published school district and campus materials (e.g., student handbooks and employee manuals).Case Studies on Physical Assault of School PersonnelWhile the preponderance of published data addresses assault against classroom teachers, other school employee groups have experienced assault, as well. The following three cases illustrate actual incidents of physical assault against school personnel. Case 1 describes a situation where a high school teacher was physically assaulted by a student, while the other two cases relate incidents where a principal and bus driver were physically assaulted by a parent. These cases highlight the dangerous level of violence that can be inflicted on school personnel while on duty.* Case 1: In 2010 a teacher at Cleveland High School in Seattle required medical treatment after being assaulted by a student. The assault happened after the teacher directed the student to complete his work. He refused, began to tear up papers, and without warning, slapped the teacher in the face. The teacher had a laceration with bleeding and swelling that required four stitches. School staff removed the student from the school, but did not immediately file a police report. The student allegedly admitted to striking the teacher because he wanted him “out of his personal space.” Police became involved in the matter when an officer was called to the hospital where the teacher was being treated. It was not clear who alerted the police that the teacher was being medically treated for the assault. When asked why school officials did not immediately call the police regarding the incident, a school official responded: “It's a complex situation and because of student privacy, I’m not able to share those details” (McNerthney 2010McNerthney, Casey. 2010. Police: Seattle high school teacher sent to hospital by student assault. Seattle PI, January 29.http://www.seattlepi.com/local/414812_school30.html. [Google Scholar], 1–2).* Case 2: In 2011 the first-year principal of Fillmore Elementary in Stockton Unified School District (California) was taken to the hospital by ambulance for minor injuries after being assaulted by a parent. The assault happened outside the school office around 9:00 A.M., after the principal told the parent's nine-year-old son that he would need to wear his T-shirt inside out or change it since the T-shirt violated the newly implemented uniform code. The mother of the student confronted the principal. The argument escalated, with the parent punching the principal multiple times, resulting in the principal bleeding. The parent was charged with two misdemeanors and two felonies. Security at campuses in the school district had been a major concern since many security personnel were let go the previous year because of budget cuts (Johnson 2011Johnson, C. 2011. Fillmore Elementary principal attacked by parent, police say. News10/KXTV (Stockton, CA ), August 29.http://www.news10.net/news/article/152211/2/Stockton-police-Students-mother-attacks-principal. [Google Scholar], 1).* Case 3: In 2009 a parent whose daughter attended the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District (North Carolina) requested a new bus stop for her daughter. She was upset that the temporary stop was too far for her daughter to walk. While elementary school children who were riding the bus looked on, the mother boarded the bus and proceeded to attack the 57-year-old bus driver. Witnesses described the attack as “violent.” Another parent came to the defense of the bus driver and pulled the mother off the bus, ending the assault. The parent faced assault and battery charges along with trespassing charges by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department (“CMS” 2009, 1).Workplace Violence of School PersonnelAlthough little is heard in the media about the victimization of school employees, this type of school violence is a serious issue in the United States (American Psychological Association 2013American Psychological Association. 2013. Violence against teachers: A silent national crisis.http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/activities/violence-against.aspx. [Google Scholar], 1). School violence can take many different forms: verbal threats, theft of possessions, bullying, and physical assault (Tiesman 2008Tiesman, Hope. 2008. Violence against teachers and school staff. NIOSH Science Blog, July 18.http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2008/04/teacher/. [Google Scholar], 2). To this list of violent acts, Asthana (2009Asthana, Anushka. 2009. Teachers fight back against false claims of pupil assault. The Observer, October 24.http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/oct/25/teachers-fight-false-allegations-assault. [Google Scholar], 1) adds false accusations, some of which can be malicious in nature. Physical assault can be described as acts of kicking, hitting, pushing, slapping, stabbing, as well as shooting (Simpson 2011Simpson, Michael. 2011. When educators are assaulted. National Education Association.http://www.nea.org/home/42238.htm. [Google Scholar], 2). Serious injury that results from an assault has been defined as “an attack upon another person whereby the Victim suffers Serious Injury involving broken bones, loss of teeth, internal injuries, severe laceration or loss of consciousness, and medical attention or hospitalization is sought for the Victim” (New Hanover County Public Schools 2013New Hanover County Public Schools. 2013. Policy 8410 policies, rules and procedures relative to student discipline in the New Hanover County Schools.http://www.nhcs.k12.nc.us/policies/series8000/8410.pdf. [Google Scholar], 2). Physical assault of school personnel carries both monetary (e.g., lower earnings because of work missed, medical expenses [American Psychological Association 2013American Psychological Association. 2013. Violence against teachers: A silent national crisis.http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/activities/violence-against.aspx. [Google Scholar], 1]) and nonmonetary costs (e.g., burnout, reduced productivity, elevated blood pressure, headaches; Buck 2006Buck, Chad Anthony. 2006. The effects of direct and indirect experiences with school crime and violence on high school teacher burnout. PhD diss., Georgia State University Digital Archive @ GSU: 1–82.http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=psych_diss. , 26–27; Steffgen and Ewen 2007Steffgen, Georges, and Norbert Ewen. 2007. Teachers as victims of school violence: The influence of strain and school culture. International Journal on Violence and School 81(3): 81–93.http://www.ijvs.org/files/Revue-03/pp-81–93-Steffgen-IJVS-n3.pdf. [Google Scholar], 82). It is estimated that the annual costs of school violence against school teachers alone is more than $2 billion (American Psychological Association 2013American Psychological Association. 2013. Violence against teachers: A silent national crisis.http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/activities/violence-against.aspx. [Google Scholar]), thus impacting taxpayers as well.The U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and the National Center for Education Statistics (2011) provide public and private school data on violence against teachers. During the 2007–2008 school year, 7 percent of teachers (kindergarten to 12th grade) in the United States reported being threatened with injury by students at school, with a larger percentage at the secondary level (8%) compared to elementary (7%). The percentage of threats with injury was higher for city schools (10%) in comparison to town schools (7%), and to rural and suburban schools (6%). The percentage of threats was higher for public school teachers (8%) compared to private school teachers (3%). When comparing teachers in public and private schools at the city level, the percentage of public school teachers who reported threats with injury was quite high (12% for public and 2% for private). In comparing male and female teachers, 9 percent of males and 7 percent of females report receiving threats of injury. This pattern was found to be consistent for city and suburban schools. The percentages of public school teachers reporting threats with injury by students in the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the 2007–2008 school year varies from a low of 3.2 percent in North Dakota to a high of 16.9 percent in the District of Columbia, with 12.8 percent in New Mexico, 12.7 percent in Maryland, and 11.7 percent in Delaware.The IES and the NCES (2011) data also indicate that the proportion of teachers who reported being physically attacked by students at school was 4 percent, with a larger percentage taking place at the elementary level (6%) in relationship to the secondary level (2%). This pattern was found to be consistent with the various geographical school settings: city, town, suburban, and rural. The percentage of reported physical attacks was higher for public school teachers (4%) compared to private school teachers (2%). When comparing public and private school teachers at the city level, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being physically attacked was very high (6% for public and 1% for private). The percentages of public school teachers reporting physical attacks by students in the 50 states as well as the District of Columbia during the 2007–2008 school year goes from a low of 1.7 percent in North Dakota and 1.8 percent in New Jersey to a high of 8.4 percent in Maryland.While the majority of violence, including physical assaults against school teachers, is caused by students (Simpson 2011Simpson, Michael. 2011. When educators are assaulted. National Education Association.http://www.nea.org/home/42238.htm. [Google Scholar]), acts of violence by parents are gaining attention in the United States as well as internationally (May 2013May, David. 2013. Problematic parental behavior in Kentucky schools. Kentucky Center for School Safety. https://kycss.org/pdfs-docs/hotpdfs/Problematic%20parental%20Behavior%20Mays.pdf. [Google Scholar], 1). The topic of parental misbehavior in schools has been largely ignored in academic as well as professional literature (May 2013May, David. 2013. Problematic parental behavior in Kentucky schools. Kentucky Center for School Safety. https://kycss.org/pdfs-docs/hotpdfs/Problematic%20parental%20Behavior%20Mays.pdf. [Google Scholar]). It has been noted that up to 70 percent of school administrators have at some point been threatened by a parent (verbal victimization), and it has been suggested that a chief reason for new teacher resignations is the tension of having to deal with the problematic behaviors of parents (May 2013May, David. 2013. Problematic parental behavior in Kentucky schools. Kentucky Center for School Safety. https://kycss.org/pdfs-docs/hotpdfs/Problematic%20parental%20Behavior%20Mays.pdf. [Google Scholar]).State Statutes That Address Physical AssaultLegal Consequences and Disciplinary Action of Physical AssaultMany states, including California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas, have passed laws that stipulate consequences and disciplinary actions for those who commit violent acts against school personnel who are on duty. For instance, the states of California and Massachusetts have penal codes (i.e., Ann.Cal.Penal Code § 241.6 and M.C.L.A. 265 § 13D) where assault and battery of public officials, a designation that includes school personnel, is listed as a criminal offense. Section 22.01 of the Texas Penal Code (i.e., V.T.C.A., Penal Code § 22.01), indicates that an assault can be upgraded to a felony of the third degree if the assault takes place against an on-duty public servant or official, for example, a school teacher.State statutes can include conditions for the expulsion of students who assault on-duty school personnel. For example, a Michigan School Code (M.C.L.A. 380.1311a) notes that a student who is in sixth grade or higher shall suffer expulsion if the pupil commits a reported act of physical assault against any school employee, contractor, or volunteer while they are on school duty. North Carolina has a statute (N.C.G.S.A. § 115C-390.9) that offers an alternative setting as an option for students on long-term suspensions, unless the superintendent has good reason (e.g., the student shows violent behavior or is a possible threat to staff members) not to offer this option. Moreover, the consequences of assault and battery can carry a sentence of incarceration in a county jail for no more than a year and/or a fine not over $2,000 (see Ann.Cal.Penal Code § 241.6).An assailant can be held accountable for physical assault of a school employee, even if the respective employee was not the intended victim. For example, in 2003 at Piqua High School in Miami County, Ohio, a teacher tried to stop an altercation by getting between two students who were fighting. The student's punch, intended for the other student, struck the teacher, injuring her back and causing her to fall to the floor. The Court of Appeals of Ohio (In re A.C.T., 158 Ohio App.3d 473, 2004-Ohio 4935) found the student who struck the teacher guilty of assault, but not guilty of the greater wrongdoing of assaulting a teacher, since the student did not intend to punch the teacher.Restitution for Physical AssaultAs compensation to a school employee physically assaulted while on duty, Texas has a statute (V.T.C.A., Education Code § 22.003(b)) that provides paid leave for a maximum of two years from when the assault occurred to recover from bodily injuries. Once the injured employee submits a written request for assault leave, the school district is required to grant this leave right away. This employee entitlement is not based on whether the individual who caused the injury can be indicted for the violent act. If the claim of physical assault is determined to be unfounded, the school district is permitted to deduct the leave period from the accrued leave time of the employee, or even the employee's pay if there is a lack of accumulated leave time to cover the leave period.In Texas if a school employee who belongs to the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) dies from a physical assault while on duty, TRS, as means of compensation, will provide a death benefit to the deceased's beneficiary totaling $160,000 (Teacher Retirement System of Texas 2013, 22).Prevention/Diffusion of Potential Physical AssaultThe use of crisis intervention strategies is a way to diffuse and to prevent possible acts of student violence. In a 2012 report titled Keeping Schools Safe: Ensuring Federal Policy Supports School Safety, Pudelski (2012Pudelski, Sasha. 2012. Keeping schools safe: Ensuring federal policy supports school safety. American Association of School Administrators.http://www.aasa.org/uploadedFiles/Policy_and_Advocacy/AASA-July-2012-Keeping-Schools-Safe.pdf. [Google Scholar], 2) writes that 41 states have developed laws, policies, regulations, and guidance statements on the use of crisis interventions (i.e., seclusion and restraint) in handling disorderly and dangerous pupil behavior in schools. To increase awareness among school personnel about past episodes of student aggression, the state of Nevada has a statute (N.R.S. 392.850(1)) that requires school district administration to notify staff about students who have tried to cause or did cause critical physical harm to someone during the prior three years, if staff members are going to be in contact with these pupils on a regular basis.Professional Associations for School PersonnelProfessional associations at the state and national levels are available for various school-related personnel. These organizations can be sources of relevant information and professional development and can serve as advocates in developing policies to promote school safety for school personnel. Moreover, depending on their purpose and mission, professional associations may also provide legal assistance to school employees who have been assaulted while on duty.For school administrators, there are professional associations at the state and national levels (e.g., the American Association of School Administrators). For classroom teachers, there are multiple state and national associations; for instance, the Texas State Teachers Association (TSTA), Texas American Federation of Teachers (TFT), National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Likewise, school counselors have professional groups at both the state and national levels (e.g., Texas School Counselor Association and American School Counselor Association).Professional organizations can assist in providing current information and training, as well as be advocates in developing and endorsing school policies to address school safety issues, especially for school employees. In Keeping Schools Safe (Pudelski 2012Pudelski, Sasha. 2012. Keeping schools safe: Ensuring federal policy supports school safety. American Association of School Administrators.http://www.aasa.org/uploadedFiles/Policy_and_Advocacy/AASA-July-2012-Keeping-Schools-Safe.pdf. [Google Scholar]) the American Association of School Administrators (AASA) advocates that federal funds be made available to school districts to support employee training in the use of intervention strategies based on data. “According to AASA's survey, most school districts have not experienced any injuries of school personnel when applying seclusion and restraint techniques” (Pudelski 2012Pudelski, Sasha. 2012. Keeping schools safe: Ensuring federal policy supports school safety. American Association of School Administrators.http://www.aasa.org/uploadedFiles/Policy_and_Advocacy/AASA-July-2012-Keeping-Schools-Safe.pdf. [Google Scholar], 18).Professional associations can be a viable source of legal assistance and support to employees when assault occurs. The Madison Teachers Inc. in Wisconsin and the Massachusetts Teachers Association are examples of organizations that will provide legal support to school teachers in assault cases (Simpson 2011Simpson, Michael. 2011. When educators are assaulted. National Education Association.http://www.nea.org/home/42238.htm. [Google Scholar], 2–3). In Michigan there was a situation where the state teacher association got directly involved in the legal fray that occurred when four teachers in the Lansing, Michigan school district were physically assaulted by students. Together, the Michigan Education Association, the Lansing Schools Education Association, and the four teachers brought forward a lawsuit against the school board of Lansing (Lansing Schools Educ. Ass’n v. Lansing Bd. of Educ., 282 Mich. Ct. App. 165, 772 NW2d 784 [249 Ed. Law Rep. [397] (2009)]). The purpose of the lawsuit was to compel the Lansing school board to expel, not simply to suspend, the students who had physically assaulted the four teachers (Lansing Schools Educ. Ass’n v. Lansing Bd. of Educ. 2009). In reversing the decisions of the lower courts, the Michigan Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently demonstrated that they were injured by the failure of the Lansing school board to execute the statute M.C.L.A. 380.1311a, the purpose of which was to protect school teachers from acts of assault (Lansing Schools Educ. Ass’n v. Lansing Bd. of Educ., 487 Mich. 349, 792 N.W.2d 686 [263 Ed. Law Rep. [360] (2010)]).Another example of a school employee supported by a professional association occurred in May 2010 at Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) High School in the United Independent School District, located in Laredo, Texas. Todd Diaz, a teacher and chair of LBJ's art department, had his eye pop out of the socket while attempting to break up a physical fracas between students. He was taken to San Antonio, about 200 miles away, for emergency surgery. The school district reported that the student who had elbowed the teacher stated it was an accident. Students were disciplined as directed by the Student Code of Conduct; however, no details were issued regarding whether any of the students were arrested. The representative of the local chapter of the TSTA filed a written assault leave request for Diaz (Georgiou 2010Georgiou, Nick. 2010. Fight damages eye. Laredo Morning Times . (Texas), May 13, 1A, 12A. [Google Scholar], 1A, 12A).Recommended Policies and ProceduresSchool districts and campuses need to develop policies and procedures that are both proactive (to deter and prevent assaults) and reactive (to responsibly address assaults). Having policies and procedures that address school violence issues (e.g., reporting verbal abuse and threats) and effectively disseminating this information so school staff, parents, and students are aware of these policies can help to decrease the risks of physical assault (Feda 2008Feda, Denise. 2008. Written violence policies and assault deterrents in Minnesota schools: Impact on educators’ risk of physical assault. PhD diss., University of Minnesota. ProQuest (AAT 3295685).http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1456297021&Fmt=2&clientId=105&RQT=309&VName=PQD. , 1). The policies, procedures, and practices presented in the following list offer suggestions that can help to protect school personnel and minimize injury.1. Create a school safety plan. Various organizations, such as the National Institute of Justice (http://www.nij.gov/nij/topics/crime/school-crime/school-safety/safety-plan.htm#schoolsafetyriskassessment) have assessment tools that can be beneficial in the development of such a plan.2. School districts and campuses should implement appropriate school security procedures, including access control and visitor screening.3. District policies and campus handbooks should clearly define the different types of assault (e.g., simple assault and aggravated assault), so employees, parents, and students can have an understanding about the different forms of assault. For instance, the Houston Independent School District (HISD) has in its district board policy manual a description of what simple assault means: “Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another” (Houston Independent School District 2013Houston Independent School District (HISD). 2013. Houston Independent School District board policy manual: Student conduct: Assaults.http://pol.tasb.org/Policy/Download/592?filename= FNCH(LEGAL).pdf. [Google Scholar], 1). All policy manuals should reflect a zero tolerance for any acts of school violence against school personnel.4. District policy needs to ensure that all assaults are reported to the police for potential legal charges. School districts need to work with their school resource officers as well as the local police department in developing procedures for the acts of physical assault on school grounds in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Procedures need to indicate the process for detaining and supervising the aggressor, contacting the police, ensuring a police report about the assault is made, and supporting the victim. Moreover, policies should indicate sanctions as a result of the assault. For example, the policy may specify that the individual be denied access to the campus for a specified period of time following the assault.5. District policies should address assault leave requests, workers’ compensation, medical evaluation procedures, and so on, for employees who have been assaulted in accordance with the policy definition. For instance, HISD has this type of information listed in its district board policy manual (Houston Independent School District 2013Houston Independent School District (HISD). 2013. Houston Independent School District board policy manual: Student conduct: Assaults.http://pol.tasb.org/Policy/Download/592?filename= FNCH(LEGAL).pdf. [Google Scholar], 1).6. District, campus, and classroom-based decision-making techniques as well as prevention and intervention programs should be made available to employees. These types of programs can help employees become more skilled in conflict resolution (e.g., de-escalation techniques) so as to be prepared for potential confrontations. Sample programs include “School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports” (http://www.pbis.org/school/what_is_swpbs.aspx), “Anger Coping Program” (http://www.emstac.org/registered/topics/posbehavior/early/anger.htm), and “Physical & Psychological Management Training” (http://www.pmtassociates.net/index.html).7. Be a problem solver. Be proactive. After a confrontation has occurred, debrief the incident to find ways to prevent future occurrences or to better handle these types of situations.ConclusionSchool violence, especially physical assault, against on-duty school personnel (e.g., teachers, administrators, secretaries, and bus drivers) is occurring throughout the United States. National government data attest to this fact (IES and NCES 2011). Assailants are not only students but also parents (May 2013May, David. 2013. Problematic parental behavior in Kentucky schools. Kentucky Center for School Safety. https://kycss.org/pdfs-docs/hotpdfs/Problematic%20parental%20Behavior%20Mays.pdf. [Google Scholar], 1). Consequences of assault can result in emotional, bodily, and financial costs for victims, but these consequences can also have far-reaching effects on assailants, employers, and the larger community, for example, taxpayers (American Psychological Association 2013American Psychological Association. 2013. Violence against teachers: A silent national crisis.http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/activities/violence-against.aspx. [Google Scholar], 1). While statutes exist to help support and protect school personnel from violence, school district administration needs to develop and implement policies and procedures to effectively address school violence in general and assault in particular, taking a proactive stance to thwart acts of workplace violence against school personnel.
