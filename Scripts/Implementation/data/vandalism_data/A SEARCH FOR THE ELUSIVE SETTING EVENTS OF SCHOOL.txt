A SEARCH FOR THE ELUSIVE SETTING EVENTS OF SCHOOL VANDALISM: A
CORRELATIONAL STUDY




 ABSTRACT
 This study was conducted in 28 intermediate schools to discover factors in the school environ-
 ment that are related to vandalism. Data were collected on vandalism and the school environ-
 ment. Vandalism cost and frequency were found to be greater in schools that had lower scores
 on a school discipline survey (p< .05). The results are discussed in terms of setting factors,
 punishment, and reinforcement.

 "Crime and violence threaten the viability of our public schools," said
 United States Attorney General William French Smith (Nicholson, 1981).
 Speaking during June, 1981, Smith called for a crackdown on violence and
 vandalism in the schools, stating that more than 250,000 students and 5,000
 teachers are physically assaulted in a typical month. In addition, the National
 School Resource Network and the California Safety Center (Nicholson, 1981)
 report that more than $600 million is spent annually on school property repair,
 security devices, insurance, and guards.
 Amidst a great public outcry to address the problems of violence and van-
 dalism, school districts have responded with so-called "hard" measures
 (Reaves, 1981). The Los Angeles Unified School District developed a security
 force of more than 325 agents and placed intrusion alarms in many schools.
 Other districts have developed means of identifying violence-prone youngsters
 This study was carried out with the assistance of a grant from the Office of the Los Angeles
 County Superintendent of Schools. The authors are grateful to Cindy Ismael and Cheng-Ou

 to all concerned agencies (i.e., juvenile court officials, the district attorney's
 office, and local police departments) or have implemented stringent student
 disciplinary programs (Reaves, 1981).
 However, one of the consistent factors alleged to be associated with high
 levels of school violence and property loss is a hostile and authoritarian at-
 titude on the part of school staff toward students (Scrimger & Elder, 1981).
 Yet, research is showing that today's schools are emphasizing more punitive
 measures in managing student behavior. For example, results from a survey
 by the American Association of School Administrators (Brodinsky, 1980)
 indicated that personnel in school districts spend more time and energy in
 implementing punitive measures than in positive or preventive measures.
 Similarly, teachers, on the average, have been observed to use disapproval
 approximately three times more frequently than approval when they respond
 to student behavior (Heller & White, 1975; Thomas, Presland, Grant, &
 Glynn, 1978; White, 1975).
 This reliance on heavy security arrangements and punitive discipline
 strategies may actually aggravate school-related violence and vandalism
 (Greenberg, 1969, 1974). Likewise, Mayer and Butterworth (1979, 1981) and
 Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, and Sulzer-Azaroff (1983) have suggested
 that relying on punishment as a school-wide and classroom management pro-
 cedure is a condition in the school environment that can actually promote
 school disruption and vandalism. Findings from the experimental analysis
 of behavior have taught us that extinction and punishment tend to provoke
 aggression and destruction by laboratory animals (Azrin, Hutchinson, &
 Hake, 1963). Research with humans also provides "mounting evidence that
 aversive stimulation generates an instigation to aggression in our species as
 well as in lower orders" (Berkowitz, 1983, p. 1139). Even frustrations and
 failures to attain a desired goal "can produce aggressive inclinations because
 of their aversive nature" (Berkowitz, 1983, p. 1 143). It would seem reasonable
 to hypothesize, then, that some proportion of the aggression and destruc-
 tion that takes place in public schools is a reaction to aversive school
 environments.
 Mayer and his colleagues (1979, 1981, 1983) also suggest additional fac-
 tors that may contribute to the punitive nature of the school discipline en-
 vironment resulting in increased vandalism. These include vague rules, in-
 consistency, lack of appropriate follow-through, and little or no allowance
 made for individual differences. The last problem mentioned is exemplified
 by a lack of individualized consequences so that everyone receives the same
 punishment for the same infraction. Such misuse of behavior management
 procedures can result in an increase, rather than a decrease, of aggressive
 behavior (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979).
 Several investigators (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth,
 Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983) have attempted to eliminate or reduce
 some of the hypothesized conditions or setting events that produce aggres-
 sion. By doing so, they were able to obtain significant reductions in vandalism.

 However, their interventions were complex staff development packages and
 individual factors possibly contributing to the reduction in vandalism were
 not isolated.
 In an attempt to establish more clearly the direction of future research,
 the present correlational study was carried out to determine specific
 characteristics of the school environment that are related to vandalism. Prior
 research in applied behavior analysis has emphasized the immediate
 antecedents and consequences of behavior. However, Wahler and Fox (1981)
 have pointed out that socially important behaviors, such as disruptive school
 behavior, truancy, and property destruction, may be under the control of
 temporally remote stimuli or setting events rather than immediate antecedents
 and consequences. To help provide descriptive analyses of these setting events,
 Wahler and Fox advocate the use of correlational analyses. This study uses
 correlational analyses in an attempt to identify possible setting events to school
 vandalism.
 Method
 Selection of Schools
 Twenty-eight intermediate schools (grades 6, 7, & 8; 7 & 8; or 7, 8, & 9)
 in Los Angeles County participated in the study. These schools represented
 communities with a wide range of socioeconomic levels as indicated by the
 percentage of students in each school receiving aid to families with depen-
 dent children (0% to 64%). The schools' student enrollments ranged from
 402 to 1639.
 In most instances, letters were sent to school principals soliciting their par-
 ticipation. In some cases, such solicitation occurred at a district principals'
 meeting. Follow-up telephone calls were made with each principal to confirm
 participation. Of 64 Los Angeles County schools contacted, 28 were selected
 due to their willingness to participate and their having readily available van-
 dalism data.
 Selection of Teachers
 In each school, three teachers were picked randomly from a list of staff
 members using a table of random numbers. Only teachers of academic sub-
 jects were selected. Special education teachers were ineligible. If a teacher
 selected by a random number did not teach an academic subject, the next
 random number was taken. All teachers selected agreed to participate in the
 study.
 Data Collection Procedures
 Vandalism. Vandalism data were obtained from each school and furnished
 by the principal or his or her secretary. The date of each incident of van-
 dalism and the cost of repairing and replacing vandalized property were
 recorded in the format shown in Figure 1 . If more than one entry was recorded
 for a particular date, the school custodian was interviewed to determine if

 the entries represented more than one incident. All vandalism that resulted
 in any cost to the school was counted as an infraction. These events includ-
 ed graffiti, breaking of glass, equipment theft, fire, and other property
 damage.
 Figure 1. Recording sheet for occurrence and cost of vandalism.
 The cost and frequency of vandalism were calculated in units per 100
 students to account for differences in school size. Vandalism cost, then, was
 calculated by dividing the total cost of repairing or replacing property van-
 dalized during a 9-month school year by the student enrollment. This result
 was then multiplied by 100 to give a figure for each school. Vandalism fre-
 quency per 100 students was obtained by dividing the total number of in-
 cidents reported during a 9-month school year by the student enrollment.
 This result was then multiplied by 100 to give a comparative figure for each
 school.
 School discipline survey . The School Discipline Survey (SDS) (Mayer, But-
 terworth, Spaulding, et al., 1983) was used as a measure of the school
 discipline environment (see Figure 2). Three major areas contributing to a
 punitive school discipline environment were identified based on previous
 research (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth, Komoto, &
 Benoit, 1983; Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983). The
 first included clarity of both school and classroom rules and discipline policies.
 It was assumed that appropriate stimulus control, or rule following, cannot
 be developed unless discipline policies and rules are clearly communicated
 (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1986). Further, a lack of rule following behavior
 tends to result in more punishment being used in the school environment.
 The second area involved administrative support for staff in student discipline
 (i.e., consistency and follow-through). If administrative support were weak
 or inconsistent, it certainly would not be reinforcing enough to support staff

 efforts aimed at school- wide discipline programs (Mayer, Butter worth,
 Komoto, & Benoit, 1983). Such a lack of support or reinforcement is also
 aversive. The third area included allowances made for individual student
 differences in carrying out discipline policies. It was assumed that when in-
 dividual differences are recognized and addressed, the environment would
 become less punitive and more positive (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979; Mayer,
 Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983).
 The original pool of items for the SDS was generated within the above
 three categories. These items were analyzed and revised according to their
 relevance to each specific area, and also according to their adherence to basic
 criteria such as grammar, difficulty, ambiguity, and overlap.
 Through a series of conferences, the final list was shaped in preparation
 for a logical or content validation process. In this process, a panel of four
 behavioral and measurement specialists reviewed the item pool for content
 validity. All panel members had to agree to each item; items not agreed upon
 were discarded or revised. Their efforts resulted in a 28-item instrument assess-
 ing school staff perceptions of discipline policies and practices.
 Of the items included on the questionnaire some items require a "yes - no"
 response, while most items require responses on a Likert-type scale on which
 the respondent must answer, "Rarely," "Sometimes," "More Often Than Not,"
 or "Consistently." Four items require a response of "Disagree," "Somewhat
 Disagree," "Somewhat Agree," or "Agree."
 The survey was administered to the three randomly selected teachers in
 each school. They were given the survey form individually and were asked
 to return it approximately one week later. They also were told that their
 responses were anonymous and confidential and that each school's scores
 would be treated as a unit.
 Scoring of the survey. The maximum possible total score on the survey
 is 136 points, indicating a positively reinforcing environment with clear
 discipline policies, good administrative support, and maximum allowance
 for individual differences. Maximum score on the Clarity section (items 1-2)
 is 32. Maximum score on the Administrative Support section (items 3-16)
 is 56. Maximum score on the Individual Differences section (items 17-28) is 48.
 For items la, b, c and 2a, b, c, four points are given for a "Yes" response
 and zero points are given for a "No" response. For items 3 through 14 and
 items 19 through 28, four points are given for the response "Consistently,"
 three points for the response "More Often Than Not," two points for
 "Sometimes" and one point for "Rarely." For item 15, four points are given
 for the response "Agree," three points for "Somewhat Agree," two points
 for "Somewhat Disagree," and one point for "Disagree." For items 16 through
 18, four points are given for the response "Disagree," three points for
 "Somewhat Disagree," two points for "Somewhat Agree," and one point for
 "Agree."

 Reliability and validity of the school discipline survey. In order to assess
 the test-retest reliability of the survey, a second group of 69 teachers from
 three of the intermediate schools was requested to complete the question-
 naire twice at an interval of two to four weeks. A Pearson correlation
 coefficient was calculated. A high reliability coefficient of .87 was obtained
 for the total survey, .83 for Clarity, .82 for Administrative Support, and
 .62 for Individual Differences.
 In addition to its use in this correlational study, the SDS was administered
 to the staffs of six schools, four junior high schools and two high schools,
 at the beginning of a comprehensive staff development project (Nafpaktitis,
 Mayer, Hollingsworth, & Butterworth, 1982). On the 198 completed surveys,
 additional support for statistical validity was provided by data on internal
 consistency. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated
 for the three sub-section scores and for the total score of the SDS. The inter-
 correlations between the three sub-sections were sufficiently low to indicate
 construct validity. The correlation between Clarity and Administrative Sup-
 port was .45; the correlation between Clarity and Individual Differences was
 .23; and the correlation between Administrative Support and Individual
 Differences was .39. These correlations suggest that each sub-section is
 measuring a different construct related to discipline policies and practices.
 Furthermore, Clarity and Administrative Support each correlated with the
 total score at .80 and Individual Differences correlated with the total score
 at .65.
 Results
 Table 1 presents the results of the School Discipline Survey and the van-
 dalism data for each school. The number of incidents of vandalism reported
 for the 9-month period ranged from 2 to 46. The cost of vandalism to a school
 for the 9 months ranged from $175 to $9,130. Table 2 lists the ranges, means,
 and standard deviations for all the variables. Table 3 displays a correlation
 matrix of measures of the school discipline survey, vandalism frequency, and
 vandalism cost. While no significant relationship was found between any of

 the survey's subscores and vandalism, the total score obtained from the school
 discipline survey was found to be related significantly to both vandalism fre-
 quency (r = - .43) and cost (r = - .39).
 Discussion
 A major factor was found to relate significantly to vandalism: a punitive
 school discipline environment, as measured by the school discipline survey.
 The school discipline environment includes several areas: clarity of rules, ad-
 ministrative support (i.e., consistency and follow-through), and the allowance
 for individual differences (i.e., appropriate selection of academic materials,
 reinforcers, and punishers). No one of these areas by itself was found to cor-
 relate significantly with vandalism, but the combination of the three areas did.
 Because correlations indicate strength of association only and are not
 evidence of a cause and effect relationship, it might be concluded that these
 findings have little relevance to the problem of school vandalism. However,
 research evidence strongly suggests that when the predictor variables in the
 SDS scale are manipulated as treatment variables, vandalism is indeed
 affected. For example, when the punitive school environment and other
 variables were treated in two different experimental studies (Mayer & But-
 terworth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer- Azaroff, 1983),
 vandalism costs decreased an average of 73.5% for 23 elementary and junior
 high schools. These findings complement those of Gold and Mann (1982),
 who also concluded that "poor scholastic experiences are significant causes
 of delinquent and disruptive behavior" (p. 313). They found that when cur-
 riculum was more individualized and the environment was made more rein-
 forcing, students behavior and scholastic performance improved.
 Perhaps, then, a punitive school discipline environment is a major factor
 contributing to school vandalism. The correlational evidence of this study,
 combined with the experimental evidence of other studies (Mayer & Butter-
 worth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983),
 would appear to support such a conclusion. Certainly, evidence is ac-
 cumulating to suggest that the discipline environment, as measured in the
 School Discipline Survey, may be a setting event for school vandalism.
 Perhaps, then, by making the school environment more reinforcing, by reduc-
 ing the frequent misuse of behavioral procedures, and by maintaining ap-
 propriate behavior through an increased use of positive reinforcement, the
 amount of vandalism in our schools can be significantly decreased.
 In our opinion, the importance of the impact of setting events on van-
 dalism has been overlooked by educators. The emphasis instead has been
 placed on security arrangements and punishment. School staff need to be
 educated as to the relevance of setting events. "Because setting events can
 function powerfully, they all must be identified and dealt with effectively if
 we are ever durably to prevent, rather than just temporarily suppress, violence
 and vandalism in our schools" (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1986, p. 342).

 SCHOOL VANDALISM 269
 Additional support for the utility of the School Discipline Survey is sug-
 gested by reactions of administrators in the study. They generally reported
 that they found information on the scale to be helpful in evaluating their
 discipline policies and in planning policy changes.
 Finally, it should be recognized that even though the correlations obtained
 between the School Discipline Survey and vandalism were statistically signi-
 ficant, they were not extremely high. Addtional research studies certainly are
 warranted to identify and substantiate the existence of setting events for van-
 dalism in order to help us to better understand and prevent this pervasive
 problem. More precise measurement of vandalism, for example, might im-
 prove our identification and understanding of its setting events. Even though
 it appears impossible to measure acts of vandalism directly, future studies
 might attempt to assess the reliability of vandalism frequency and cost
 statistics by using two independent reporters or observers.
 Inter-rater reliabilities of the School Discipline Survey also should be
 studied. Factor analysis of the items of the survey might lend additional sup-
 port to the theoretically derived categories. Studies of student and parent
 responses to the survey and correlations of the survey with aggressive or
 assaultive behavior on the campus would further strengthen the survey's
 validity.
 In the final analysis, however, despite the low correlations, the predictors
 in the survey as setting events constitute a major departure from the tradi-
 tion of measuring school climate with vague, highly subjective categories.
 The concept of setting events with objective statements of environmental
 variables presents great potential for programmatic utility. More interven-
 tions to reduce vandalism also need to be experimentally tested. These in-
 clude studying the effect on vandalism of a clear discipline policy and studies
 comparing individualized and standardized discipline approaches.
