Vandalism: Environmental and Social Factors




Vandalism: Environmental and Social Factors
Gregory Brown Ann Sloan Devlin
To explore the relationship between vandalism,
college residence hall size, and a
number of social factors, 688 college
students completed the Core Alcohol and
Drug Survey (Presley, Meilman, & Lyerla,
1994), the University Residence Environment
Scale (Moos, 1988), and answered
questions about their television habits and
athletic participation. Vandalism costs came
from college repair records. Larger residence
halls, those with more TV viewing,
more freshmen, and less student involvement
were likely to have higher vandalism costs.
Although it is commonly asserted that vandalism
has its roots in aggression (DeMore,
Fisher, & Baron, 1988), the factors that
influence aggression, and in turn vandalism,
are numerous. These factors include the use
of drugs and alcohol, gender, the influence
of the architectural environment, and other
contextual factors. Vandalism involves acts
that are intentional, destructive, and affect
property that is owned (Goldstein, 1996;
Moser, 1992). Although purposeful destruction
to schools, parks, public housing, and
transportation systems receives most of the
press, college campuses are also susceptible
to vandalism (DeMore et al.).
Theoretically, vandalism involves a
constellation of factors. Early theories
stressing instinct (e.g., Freud, 1920; Lorenz,
1966) have been replaced by those that
acknowledge the role of external stimulation
in eliciting aggression (Berkowitz, 1993;
Buss & Shackelford, 1997). The move has

been to integrate biological, sociological,
and psychological explanations of aggression
(Brennan & Raine, 1997).
Building upon such explanations, Fisher
and Baron (1982) proposed an integrative
approach concerning vandalism in a comprehensive
theory of perceived inequity. In
this model, the goal of vandalism is to create
equity for those who perceive that they are
treated unfairly. In an attempt to apply this
theory, DeMore et al. (1988) studied vandalism
in university residence halls. They
measured perceived equity and control
through the use of questionnaires, and then
had students self-report whether or not they
had vandalized the residence halls. Results
supported the idea that vandalism was
influenced by an interaction between perceived
inequity and perceived control. Men
were more likely to engage in vandalism than
women and also reported significantly lower
levels of equity and control than did women.
In a related finding in high-rise residence
halls at the University of Massachusetts,
Propst and Propst (1973) demonstrated that
the more control students had over their
rooms and use of floor space in terms of the
flexibility of their furnishings, the less
vandalism occurred.
These findings generally support the
equity-control theory of vandalism. Yet
DeMore et al. (1988) stated that other factors
might influence students to engage in
vandalism. Gender was also shown to be a
factor in the DeMore et al. (1988) study. The
authors also recognize that the environment

Vandalism
and other contextual and social factors may
contribute to vandalism. Furthermore, if
vandalism and aggression are related, as has
been argued, then stimuli that affect aggression
in certain circumstances could also
affect the likelihood that vandalism will
occur. Thus, vandalism might also be
influenced by the consumption of drugs and
alcohol, exposure to television, and other
social factors.
Alcohol, Other Drugs, and
Aggression
Few studies have actually sought to link
alcohol consumption with vandalism per se
(Norlander, Nordmarker, & Archer, 1998).
Despite the limited research, Goldstein
(1996) has shown that the consumption of
alcohol has been a frequent precursor to
vandalism. Korytnyk and Perkins (1983)
demonstrated that young men (introductory
psychology students) who had consumed
alcohol drew more graffiti than those who
had not, regardless of their belief about
whether they had consumed a drink with
alcohol. In Hetherington and Keene’s (1985)
research at a large Midwestern university,
students were classified into four groups
based on their pattern of consumption of
alcohol: Abusers (more than four drinks at
a time, 2 to 3 times per wk), Weekenders
(more than four drinks at a time, but once
per week), Users (three or fewer drinks, 2
to 3 times per week), or Socials (three or
fewer drinks, once a month or less). Related
to the topic of vandalism, 40% of those in
the Abuser group reported having damaged
property following drinking. This level was
almost twice that of the Weekender or User
groups. Independent of group status, men
were more likely to get into fights and
damage property. Further, younger students
were more likely to drink more and men
were more likely to drink more often.
Bowles (1982) noted similar trends at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville: more
men than women, more freshmen than
upperclassmen, and more students who had
been drinking than not were likely to be
involved in acts of vandalism. West, Drummond,
and Eames (1990) found similar
results with a sample of British college
students (more men drinking, more men
involved in vandalism after drinking).
Further, in a study of violence in residence
halls across 12 institutions, the reports of
resident assistants indicated that 71% of
the violent events they experienced were
deemed alcohol related (Palmer, 1996;
Palmer & Devine, 2000). Research has also
indicated that students who were members
of fraternities and sororities were more apt
to consume and abuse alcohol and be involved
in alcohol-related vandalism than
were students living in on-campus university
housing or off-campus nonuniversity housing
(Globetti, Stem, & Marasco, 1988).
Environmental Factors
Although alcohol and drug use have been
linked to aggression in countless studies,
many other factors, such as environmental
cues, have been shown to influence aggression.
Sometimes the very environment in
which a person finds himself or herself can
influence behavior. In this regard, Goldstein
(1994) has discussed what he calls the
physical ecology of aggression. When
people live as closely together as they do in
homes (or apartments or residence halls not
governed by familial structure), contact can
lead to aggression through actual or perceived
offenses (Goldstein, 1994). When the
locale is part of a larger institution such as
a school, there are even more possibilities
for aggression. For example, school size and
504 Journal of College Student Development
Brown & Devlin
class size are positively correlated with
aggressive acts (Feldhusen, 1978; Goldstein,
1994).
Crowding has also been shown to
influence aggressive behavior, whether in
homes or in schools, with a significant
number of aggressive acts occurring in more
crowded areas such as stairwells, hallways,
and cafeterias (Goldstein, 1994). School
violence also seems to occur in schools with
outdated facilities and equipment and poor
faculty morale (Greenberg as cited in
Goldstein, 1994).
The fact that close quarters seem to be
related to aggression has been studied in
some depth. It has been found that such
crowding effects are related to the personal
space requirements of individuals and even
such things as the architectural arrangement
of the residence hall (i.e., rooms off corridors
vs. suites) (Baum, Harpin, & Valins, 1975).
Baum et al. found that the degree of perceived
crowding was higher for those living
in standard college residence halls, due in
part to their corridor-based construction and
the hierarchical social structure that such an
environment fosters, than for those living in
suites. Similarly, Zaff and Devlin (1998)
found that the elderly reported a greater level
of conflict in high-rise housing (with doubleloaded
corridors) than in one-story garden
apartments.
The physical environment can also affect
much less tangible aspects of behavior such
as one’s sense of community (Riger &
Lavrakas, 1981). The role of community
itself is also an important factor, as it
provides a support network that can help to
reduce perceived threats. Community can
add to one’s perception of control, which in
turn can help to curtail aggression and
vandalism (Goldstein, 1994). Social interaction
has been shown to contribute to a
sense of community (McMillan & Chavis,
1986; Moos, 1976; Unger & Wandersman,
1982, 1983, 1985) as well as to increase selfesteem
(Goldstein, 1994).
The Media, Other Social and Developmental
Factors, and Aggression
Several other factors have been correlated
with aggression. One of the most well
researched has to do with the relationship
between aggression and violence in the
media (Huston et al., 1992). Countless
studies have documented that witnessing
aggressive models, whether live or recorded,
can increase aggressive responses in children
and adults (Liebert & Sprafkin, 1988).
Beyond media violence, other social factors
have been shown to increase aggressive
behavior. Group dynamics have been shown
to influence behavior, and groups perpetrate
most acts of vandalism (Levine & Kozak,
1979; Tobias, 1977). Fraternities and athletic
teams have been studied in the past, due to
the close-knit features of each of these
groups, to discover the relationship between
group dynamics and aggression. Both have
been found to be groups in which aggression
and aggressive acts have been encouraged,
accepted, and nourished (Hirschorn, 1988;
Koss & Gaines, 1993), although aggression
has been found to exist in fairly equal
proportions in universities and colleges
where such institutions do not exist (Koss,
Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987).
Another factor is gender. It is generally
accepted that most vandalism is committed
by men (Arluke, Kutakoff, & Levin, 1987;
DeMore et al., 1988; Otta, 1993; Schreer &
Strichartz, 1997; Ward, 1973). DeMore et al.
explained the greater incidence of vandalism
in men as being created from a greater sense
of perceived inequity.
Theories related to college student

Vandalism
development may also offer an explanation
for some of the findings. In research on the
personality development of students during
college (Chickering, 1974; Chickering,
McDowell, & Campagna, 1969), many
student characteristics are reported to
change. Of particular note is the fact that
impulse expression increases, and that the
pattern of changes across dimensions is
generally in the same direction for both men
and women. Further, one of the tasks of
college students has been managing emotions
(Chickering, 1969). Chickering (1969)
commented that aggression and sex are
among the emotions not mastered by the end
of high school, and that college offers the
opportunity to improve judgment and
sharpen cognitive processes. In Chickering’s
view, college residence halls “provide a
significant context for student development”
(1969, p. 221), and the design and regulation
of residence halls can either contribute to or
restrict the exchange of ideas. In particular,
Chickering encouraged lounge spaces that
are centrally rather than peripherally located,
and the design of spaces that are broken up
rather than uniform, to allow the opportunity
for small discussion groups. He encouraged
the mix of “persons of diverse backgrounds,
differing interests, and differing values”
(1969, p. 225) in housing. Supporting
Chickering’s interest in a mixture of students,
there is no clear mandate for housing
freshmen together (Ballou, 1986; Cade,
1979; Shelhas, 1977), at least in terms of the
impact of this arrangement on academic
performance (Ballou, 1985).
Colleges are obviously places where the
opportunity for vandalism exists, where there
is peer pressure, alcohol, and drug use, media
exposure, residence hall living, and athletic
participation. Although some research
indicates that enforcement of alcohol and
drug policies can reduce vandalism at
colleges (Lively, 1998), alcohol arrests at
colleges are on the rise, up 25% in 1998
(Nicklin, 2000), whether through tougher
enforcement or increased use. Colleges thus
provide a fertile environment in which
to study the factors that are related to
vandalism.
The Study
The goal of this study was to examine
vandalism as it relates to many aspects of
student life on the campus of a small liberal
arts college. Unlike previous studies on
vandalism, several factors such as alcohol
and drug consumption, exposure to television,
students’ influence and involvement
in their residence halls, residence hall size,
athletic team membership, and gender, were
investigated. Vandalism was operationalized
as the cost of repair to acts deemed “vandalism”
in records kept by the physical plant
department of a small liberal arts college.
The following hypotheses were formulated:
1. Residence halls with fewer students
would have lower vandalism costs.
2. Residence halls with higher levels of
student influence and involvement
would have lower vandalism costs.
3. Residence halls in which there were
higher alcohol and drug consumption,
greater exposure to television, and
greater membership on athletic teams
would have higher vandalism costs.
4. Vandalism costs would be higher in
residence halls with greater proportions
of men than women.
Previous studies on vandalism have
sought to find relationships between one or
two variables and vandalism, however we
506 Journal of College Student Development
Brown & Devlin
sought to gain a more comprehensive picture
of vandalism as it exists on a college campus.
Furthermore, because vandalism was being
investigated in terms of residence hall
characteristics and profiles, this research
may be helpful in modifying existing
housing criteria in a manner that may reduce
vandalism.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were 1,088 students at a small
liberal arts college in the Northeastern
United States. At the time of this study, 1,514
students resided on campus. Of these 1,088
participants, the data from 400 were eliminated
due to incomplete questionnaires,
yielding an N of 688 for the primary analysis.
Setting
The college has 22 residence halls (21 in use
at the time of this study), most of which are
mixed class (freshmen plus upperclassmen)
and coed. There are no fraternities and
sororities, and only about 30 students
annually (almost all seniors) live off campus.
Students are governed by an academic and
social honor code and share in the governance
of the college (i.e., students have
voting members on the college committee
that sets priorities and makes budget recommendations).
Materials
We used the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey
(Presley, Meilman, & Lyerla, 1994) to assess
drug and alcohol consumption. This questionnaire
was developed by the Core Institute
at Southern Illinois University, and the
authors reported the reliability of selected
questions from .64 to .90 (Presley, Meilman,
& Lyerla, 1993). From the 39 questions
(many involving stems) in this survey, we
analyzed responses from the two questions:
“Think back over the last 2 weeks. How
many times have you had five or more drinks
at a sitting?” (none, once, twice, 3 to 5 times,
6 to 9 times, 10 or more times). The second
question (involving 12 substances) had the
stem: “During the past 30 days on how many
days did you have” (tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, sedatives,
hallucinogens, opiates, inhalants,
designer drugs, steroids, other illegal drugs)?
This question thus produced 12 separate
responses for each participant. For each
substance, the following response categories
were used: 0 days, 1 to 2 days, 3 to 5 days,
6 to 9 days, 10 to 19 days, 20 to 29 days, all
30 days. For purposes of analysis, the
responses to the alcohol and drug questions
were summed to produce a composite score,
and divided by the number of questions. This
score is hereafter referred to as the composite
drug use score. Higher scores indicate more
frequent substance use.
The University Residence Environment
Scale Form S (URES) (Moos, 1988; Moos
& Gerst, 1974) was used to measure the
social climate of each residence hall. Form
S of the URES is a 40-item questionnaire
that is divided into 10 subscales that measure
Involvement, Emotional Support, Independence,
Traditional Social Orientation,
Competition, Academic Achievement, Intellectuality,
Order and Organization, Student
Influence, and Innovation. These subscales
are then grouped according to dimensions.
The Involvement and Emotional Support
subscales constitute the Relationship dimension,
which measures the level of interpersonal
support, feelings of friendship, and
student involvement, as well as the extent
of staff support to students. The Personal
Growth or Goal Orientation dimension is
JULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 507
Vandalism
designed to measure the emphasis on personal
and social maturation including
different aspects of academic growth. It is
comprised of the Independence, Traditional
Social Orientation, Competition, Academic
Achievement, and Intellectuality subscales.
Finally, the System Maintenance and Change
dimension, which is made up of the Order
and Organization, Student Influence, and
Innovation subscales, assesses the influence
of students in running their residence hall,
the extent to which change is accepted, and
the degree to which the residence hall runs
in an organized manner. Form S was selected
because it was designed for use where living
groups are the unit of study. Results were
analyzed using the three dimensions: Relationship
(R); Personal Growth (PG); System
Maintenance and Change (SMC). Higher
scores indicate a greater degree of the
dimension. Scores for the R dimension range
from 0 to 8; for PG they range from 0 to 20;
for SMC they range from 0 to 12. Moos
(1988) reported that the intraclass correlations
between Form S and Form R (the
longer Real Form) are all at least .86,
indicating that the results of Form S are
similar to those of Form R. The alphas for
Form R for the 10 subscales range from .77
to .88, with a mean of .82 (Moos, 1988).
A third, short, researcher-designed
questionnaire was created to determine the
levels of participation in athletics (“Do you
participate in a varsity or club sport this
semester?”), coded yes or no, and media
exposure (“On average, how much TV do
you watch per day?”). The television
response choices were: 0 hours, 1 to 2 hours,
3 to 5 hours, or more than 5 hours per day.
Vandalism was measured by residence hall
damage reports for the Fall 1999 semester
that were made available at the beginning
of the Spring 2000 semester. These reports
contained just those events that were deemed
vandalism by the Campus Safety Office, and
were subsequently broken down according
to the residence hall in which the incident
occurred. Such incidents as graffiti, holes in
walls, broken windows, and torn-down exit
signs were all considered acts of vandalism
unless such incidents were considered
accidental or fight-related, as this damage
is not intentional, and therefore does not fit
the model of perceived equity and perceived
control. Each residence hall’s extent of
vandalism was then determined by the dollar
value at which each incident was repaired,
summed across incidents. These figures were
rounded to the nearest dollar. To make sure
that the dollar cost was a reasonable estimate
of the extent of dorm vandalism, a correlation
was computed between the dollar
cost of vandalism for each dorm and the
number of incidents of vandalism in that
dorm. It was significant, r(21) = .902,
p < .001, suggesting that the dollar estimate
is a reasonable index.
Gender and class year breakdowns for
each residence hall (and hence for all
students) were obtained through the Office
of Student Life and were also available
through the Core data questionnaires for
those students who completed the survey.
Procedure
This study was conducted in conjunction
with the Office of Student Life, which took
responsibility for the distribution of questionnaires
involved in this study. The three
questionnaires were distributed at residence
hall meetings following Thanksgiving break
in the Fall 1999 semester. Students were
strongly encouraged to attend these meetings,
but attendance was not mandatory. A
fourth questionnaire not associated with this
study was also distributed at this time.

RESULTS
Residence Hall Groupings
To examine the relationship between residence
hall size and vandalism, we used
quartiles to establish size categories. Category
Size 1 consisted of five residence halls
housing between 12 and 46 students. Of
these five residences, four were on the
perimeter of the campus and were of varying
architecture, whereas one was more centrally
located on campus and was constructed of
traditional classical architecture. Category
Size 2 had six residence halls housing from
57 to 78 students. All six were on campus;
five of the six were traditional classical
architecture; the sixth was part of an
interconnected complex on the north end of
the campus. Category Size 3 had five
residence halls housing from 82 to 99
students. Two of these were of traditional
classical architecture on campus; three of
these were part of the interconnected
complex at the north end of campus. Category
Size 4 was five residence halls housing
from 104 to 115 students. Four of these were
traditional classical architecture; the fifth
was one of the interconnected dorms on the
north end of campus.
Vandalism Costs and Other
Dependent Variables
We conducted a MANOVA to test the effects
of residence hall size, gender, and athletic
participation on the costs of vandalism, the
three URES dimensions, television viewing
habits, and the composite drug use score as
dependent variables. To avoid the possibility
of 4-way interaction effects, we conducted
a second MANOVA using class year, gender,
and residence hall size as the quasi-independent
variables (with the same dependent
variables). The sample size for this analysis
differed by one (N = 687) from the other
analysis because one participant omitted the
class year data. These results will be reported
after the first analysis.
The first analysis revealed a multivariate
effect for gender, Wilks’s Lambda = .949,
F(6, 667) = 5.98, p = .000, and a multivariate
effect for size, Wilks’s Lambda = .374,
F(18, 1887.05) = 43.56, p = .000. There was
also a multivariate interaction effect for
gender and residence hall size, Wilks’s
Lambda = .955, F(18, 1887.05) = 1.72,
p = .031, and a three-way interaction between
size, gender, and athletic status,
Wilks’s Lambda = .958, F(18, 1887.05) =
1.62, p = .048.
For gender, univariate effects indicated
significant differences for cost, F(1, 672) =
3.95, p = .047; television, F(1, 672) = 5.23,
p = .023, the URES SMC dimension,
F(1, 672) = 8.71, p = .003, and the drug use
measure, F(1, 672) = 16.92, p = .000.
Overall, vandalism costs were lower for
women (M = 7.48, SD = 5.77, n = 451) than
for men (M = 7.89, SD = 5.86, n = 237). Men
(M = 2.03, SD = 0.82, n = 237) reported
watching significantly more television than
did women (M = 1.86, SD = 0.80, n = 451).
Men were also significantly higher on the
drug use measure (M = 1.49, SD = 0.53) than
were women (M = 1.37, SD = 0.36). Women
were higher on the URES SMC dimension
(M = 8.28, SD = 2.11) than were men
(M = 7.70, SD = 2.19).
For residence hall size, univariate
analyses indicated a significant effect for
cost, F(3, 672) = 326.71, p = .000; television
viewing, F(3, 672) = 3.90, p = .009, the
URES R dimension, F(3, 672) = 4.32,
p = .005, the URES SMC dimension,
F(3, 672) = 5.02, p = .002, and drug use,
F(3, 672) = 12.14, p = .000. For the vandalism
cost variable, Tukey post hoc tests
JULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 509
Vandalism
indicated that Size 1 residence halls had
significantly lower costs than Size 2 (p =
.000), Size 3 (p = .000), and Size 4 (p = .000)
residence halls; Size 2 residence halls had
significantly lower costs than both Size 3
(p = .000) and Size 4 (p = .000) residence
halls; and Size 3 residence halls had significantly
lower costs than Size 4 residence
halls (p = .000).
For the television viewing variable,
Tukey post hoc tests indicated that residents
in Size 1 residence halls reported watching
significantly less television than either those
in Size 3 residence halls (p = .015) or Size
4 residence halls (p = .010). For the URES
R dimension, Tukey post hoc tests indicated
that Size 1 residence halls had significantly
higher scores than Size 2 (p = .002), Size 3
(p = .000) and Size 4 (p = .000) residence
halls. On the URES SMC dimension, Size 1
residence halls had significantly higher
scores than Size 4 residence halls (p = .015),
and Size 2 residence halls had significantly
higher scores than Size 3 residence halls
(p = .008) and Size 4 residence halls
(p = .000).
For the composite drug use measure,
Tukey post hoc tests indicated that Size 1
residence halls had significantly more use
than Size 2 residence halls (p = .000) and
that Size 2 residence halls had significantly
less use than Size 3 residence halls (p = .000)
and Size 4 residence halls (p = .000) (see
Table 1 for the means and standard deviations
related to size).
Interaction effects. There were two
interaction effects related to gender and size,
one on the URES PG dimension, the other
on the URES SMC dimension. Simple
effects follow-up tests for the PG dimension
indicated significant differences between
men and women in residence hall Sizes 1
(p < .05) and 2 (p < .01), but not for 3 and
4. In Size 1 residence halls, men (M = 11.23,
SD = 3.10, n = 26) had significantly higher
scores than did women (M = 10.08, SD =
2.64, n = 49), whereas in Size 2 residence
halls women (M = 11.04, SD = 2.64, n =
122) had significantly higher scores than did
men (M = 9.97, SD = 3.09, n = 70). For the
URES SMC dimension, simple effects
follow-up tests indicated significant gender

differences in Size 2 and 3 residence halls,
but not in Size 1 and 4 halls. In Size 2
residence halls, women (M = 8.84, SD =
2.06, n = 122) had significantly higher scores
than did men (M = 8.04, SD = 2.39, n = 70).
Similarly, women’s scores in Size 3 residence
halls (M = 8.28, SD = 1.97, n = 132)
were significantly higher than men’s
(M = 7.09, SD = 2.22, n = 68).
There was also a three-way interaction
effect involving residence hall size, gender,
and athletic status on the URES PG dimension.
Simple effects follow-up tests indicated
that in Sizes 1 and 4 residence halls, the PG
scores of men who were athletes did not
differ significantly from those of men who
were not athletes, nor did the scores of
women who were athletes differ significantly
from those of women who were not athletes.
However, in both Size 2 and Size 3 residence
halls, the PG scores of men who were
athletes differed significantly from those of
men who were not athletes, whereas the
scores of women athletes vs. non-athletes in
those two residence hall sizes did not. In Size

(M = 10.97, SD = 2.43, n = 29) than those of
men who were not athletes (M = 9.27,
SD = 3.33, n = 41). Similarly, in Size 3
residence halls, the scores of men who were
athletes were significantly higher
(M = 11.42, SD = 3.31, n = 33) than those of
men who were not athletes (M = 9.57,
SD = 2.45, n = 35).
Beyond the multivariate effects found in
the first analysis, the second MANOVA
(with class year, gender, and residence hall
size) revealed a significant multivariate
effect for class year, Wilks’s Lambda = .944,
F(18, 1838.96) = 2.09, p = .005, and a significant
class year by size interaction effect,
Wilks’s Lambda = .882, F(54, 3318. 96)
= 1.53, p = .008.
Univariate tests indicated significant
findings involving class year for the following
variables: URES R dimension, F(3, 655)
= 2.76, p = .041; URES PG dimension,
F(3, 655) = 2.78, p = .041; and the composite
drug use measure, F(3, 655) = 2.98,
p = .031. The findings for cost approached
significance, F(3, 655) = 2.20, p = .087.
Tukey post hoc tests indicated that for
the URES R dimension, freshmen had

significantly higher scores than either juniors
(p = .002) or seniors (p = .040). For the
URES PG dimension, sophomores had
significantly higher scores than seniors
(p = .012). For the composite drug use
measure, no significant comparisons occurred,
reflecting a weak univariate effect.
Theoretical interest in the cost variable
related to students’ emotional maturity
argued for examination of the post hoc tests
for cost and class year. They indicated that
freshmen had significantly higher costs than
sophomores (p = .000), juniors (p = .000),
and seniors (p = .000) (see Table 2 for means
and standard deviations related to class year).
Class year interaction effects. The
univariate interaction effect between residence
hall size and class year involved the
composite drug use measure, F(9, 655)
= 4.27, p = .000. Simple effects follow-up
tests indicated that in Size 1 residence halls,
sophomores had significantly greater use
(M = 1.93, SD = 1.26, n = 16) than freshmen
(M = 1.31, SD = 0.28, n = 6), Juniors
(M = 1.50, SD = 0.46, n = 15) or seniors
(M = 1.42, SD = 0.39, n = 38), all p < .01. In
size 2 residence halls, it was freshmen who
had significantly greater use (M = 1.30,
SD = 0.37, n = 73) than sophomores
(M = 1.19, SD = 0.31, n = 50), p < .05. In
Size 3 residence halls, sophomores had
significantly less use (M = 1.40, SD = 0.38,
n = 65) than either juniors (M = 1.52,
SD = 0.47, n = 41) or seniors (M = 1.54,
SD = 0.46, n = 25), p < .05. Finally, in Size
4 residence halls, sophomores (M = 1.50,
SD = 0.36, n = 44) and seniors (M = 1.55,
SD = 0.33, n = 46) had significantly greater
use than freshmen (M = 1.39, SD = 0.39,
n = 97).
Correlations were also conducted relating
cost to television viewing, the composite
drug use score, number of students in a
residence hall, and the three URES dimensions.
The costs of vandalism were significantly
related to the composite drug total,
r(988) = .091, p = .004, to television viewing,
r(807) = .096, p = .006, to the URES R
dimension, r(807) = –.109, p = .002, to the
URES SMC dimension, r(807) = –.123,
p = .000, and to the number of students in
the dorm, r(21) = .770, p = .000.
Finally, using campus-wide data
(N = 1,514), a number of chi-squares were
conducted to determine the distribution of
gender and class year across residence hall
size. The chi-squared analysis for gender was
not significant, χ2
(3, N = 1,514) = 4.06,
p = .255, indicating that the proportion of
men to women (about 45% to 55%) did not
differ across residence hall sizes. In terms
of class years, the campus-wide data revealed
a difference across residence hall size,
χ2
(9, N = 1,514) = 93.78, p = .000. The
difference appeared to be in the distribution
of freshmen in Size 1 residence halls. There,
freshmen comprised only 8.3% of the
residents, whereas seniors comprised 45.8%.
In Size 2, 3, and 4 residence halls, freshmen
comprised approximately 30% to 40%,
whereas seniors comprised approximately
15% to 25%. These analyses using campuswide
data paralleled those using collected
data, one indication that the sample was
representative.
Only collected data were available to
examine the relationship between athletic
participation and residence hall size. A
chi-squared analysis was significant,
χ2
(3, N = 807) = 17.48, p = .001. The difference
again appeared in the Size 1 residence
halls, where athletes comprised only 18.9%
of the population. In the other residence hall
sizes, the proportion of athletes to nonathletes
was about 35-45% athletes to
55-65% nonathletes.

DISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest that
residence hall size, residence hall composition,
student involvement and influence,
and television-viewing time may be related
to the occurrence of residence hall vandalism.
The significant positive correlation
between the number of students in a residence
hall and vandalism costs suggests that
size does, in fact, matter. Although residence
hall size explains a significant portion of the
variance (59%), it cannot be the sole
explanation. Thus, other factors may help to
explain the occurrence of vandalism.
As hypothesized, another important
component may be the quality of student
involvement and influence within a residence
hall. Residence halls did differ in
terms of the URES R dimension, which
includes the Involvement and Emotional
Support subscales, and the SMC dimension,
which assesses the degree to which students
have a role in running the residence hall. The
R dimension measures the level of interpersonal
support, feelings of friendship, and
student involvement in a residence hall.
Students in Size 1 residence halls had the
highest R scores, significantly higher than
those for students in the other residence hall
sizes. Thus, higher levels of social support
may be related to lower levels of vandalism.
A somewhat similar pattern emerged for the
SMC dimension in terms of students in
smaller residence halls having higher (more
positive) scores. Students in Size 1 residence
halls had higher scores than those in Size 4
residence halls, and those in Size 2 residence
halls were higher on this dimension than
those in both Size 3 and Size 4 residence
halls. These findings support the model of
Fisher and Baron (1982) in that having a
voice in running the residence hall may be
related to levels of perceived equity and
control. The finding that smaller residence
halls had more involvement and emotional
support is also related to the work of Oscar
Newman (1973). Newman showed that when
fewer people live together and share common
entrances in public housing, they are
more likely to get to know each other and
to exert territorial prerogatives over their
shared space. Essentially, they are more
likely to protect that space against such
actions as vandalism.
As hypothesized, the amount of television
watched also may be related to
vandalism. The role of television viewing
suggests a different approach to student life
in Size 1 residence halls, where there was
less television viewing (between 0 and 1 to
2 hours per day) than in Size 3 and Size 4
residence halls, where students reported
watching 1 to 2 hours per day. Students in
Size 2 residence halls fell between, not
significantly different in reported use
between either Size 1 or Sizes 3 and 4. One
possible explanation for the lower level of
television viewing in Size 1 residence halls
may relate to the greater percentage of
seniors in these halls. During their senior
year, many students face significant challenges,
including demanding academic
projects (e.g., thesis work and individual
studies) as well as graduate school applications
or job searches. Less time may be left
for relaxation.
In contrast to the stated hypotheses, there
was no a clear-cut relationship between
residence hall vandalism costs and the
composite drug use measure. On the composite
drug use score, students in Size 2
residence halls had the least frequent use,
significantly less than those in Size 1.
Students in Size 2 halls also had significantly
less frequent use than those in Size 3 and
Size 4 halls. Although the costs of vandalism
JULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 513
Vandalism
were significantly correlated to the composite
drug use score and to the number of
students in the residence hall, the residents
in the smallest residence halls (Size 1) may
have felt a freedom to engage in more drug
use on the perimeter of campus (where 4 of
the 5 Size 1 residence halls were located).
One might be tempted to assume that seniors
(secure in their identities and engaging in
responsible use) were responsible for this
greater use, but an interaction effect between
residence hall size and class year on the drug
use dimension indicated that in Size 1
residence halls, sophomores reported significantly
higher use than freshmen, juniors,
and seniors. Thus, although Size 1 residence
halls had the lowest vandalism costs, the
behavior of sophomores in that setting might
raise concerns about the distribution of class
years in housing that is more peripherally
located.
Before reaching any conclusions about
the role of residence hall size in the costs of
vandalism, it is important to consider the
distributions of men and women, athletes,
and class year across the residence hall sizes.
The chi-squared analysis from collected data
indicated that Size 1 residence halls differed
in the proportion of athletes to nonathletes
in comparison to the other three residence
hall sizes, where the proportions were
approximately 35-45% athlete to 55-65%
nonathlete. In the Size 1 residence halls, less
than 20% of the students were athletes. This
was also the residence hall grouping with the
lowest vandalism costs. This finding could
be explained by the peer-group influence
theory proposed by Levine and Kozak
(1979) and Tobias (1977), with more vandalism
in residence halls where there are more
athletes, mirroring the findings in other
studies in this area (Hirschorn, 1988; Koss
& Gaines, 1993); however, Size 2 residence
halls, which also have relatively low vandalism
costs (relative to Size 3 and 4 halls), did
not differ substantially from Sizes 3 and 4
with regard to the proportion of athletes. This
finding calls into question the role of athletic
team membership in the occurrence of
vandalism. From the multivariate analysis,
there was only one result involving athletic
team membership, a three-way interaction
with residence hall size, gender, and athletic
status. This interaction indicated that in Size
2 and 3 residence halls, the PG scores of men
who were athletes were significantly higher
than those of men who were not, whereas
no such differences occurred for women. The
implication of this finding as it relates to
vandalism is not clear, especially because
there were no such differences in Size 4
residence halls, which had the highest
vandalism costs. The role of athletic team
participation in the occurrence of college
vandalism merits further examination.
Another hypothesis was related to
gender ratios in the residence halls. Of the
1,514 students on campus, 43.9% were men.
The chi-squared analysis of the campus-wide
data indicated no significant difference in
the proportions of men to women across
residence halls; the proportion of men
(~45.0%) to women (~55.0%) was similar
across sizes and reflects the proportions in
the college as a whole. Thus, the hypothesis
that vandalism costs would be higher in
residence halls with greater proportions of
men than women could not be evaluated.
However, across residence halls, gender was
related to the costs of vandalism. Even with
the preponderance of women on the campus,
men were still associated with slightly higher
vandalism costs, which mirrors the finding
in the literature that men are more likely to
be involved in vandalism (DeMore et al.,
1988; Ward, 1973). Men also watched more
514 Journal of College Student Development
Brown & Devlin
television and reported more frequent drug
use. It may be appropriate to try to keep the
proportions of men to women similar across
campus residence halls.
Although no specific hypothesis regarding
vandalism and the ratio of upperclassmen
to underclassmen within residence halls was
postulated, the data indicate that class
distribution may contribute to vandalism.
Freshmen were associated with significantly
higher vandalism costs than were the other
three classes, and freshmen are underrepresented
in Size 1 residence halls, the
halls with the lowest vandalism costs. Some
of the differences in vandalism may arise
from issues of maturity as Chickering (1969)
has suggested. Freshmen students may be
more likely to vandalize than upperclassmen.
Other research has indicated that in residence
halls for freshmen, the first quarter of the
school year is a particularly difficult time in
terms of alcohol use and subsequent sanctions.
During this period, resident assistants
and the students come to understand both the
rules and the sanctions regarding underage
drinking (Rubington, 1991).
It is also possible that freshmen have
more of their academic life dictated, with a
host of requirements to fulfill, whereas
upperclassmen have more control over their
academic choices, which may give them
higher levels of perceived control. The issue
of control is also seen in the strong correlation
between the number of residents in
the residence halls and vandalism costs: the
more students, the less likely the perceived
control. This finding suggests a relationship
between social density and vandalism and
is supported by Goldstein’s (1994) work.
An argument can be made that students
in Size 1 residence halls are self-selected,
and may have been individuals unlikely to
perpetrate vandalism under any circumstances.
For that reason, it is instructive to
look more closely at the differences and
similarities between Size 1 residence halls,
which have a greater degree of self-selection,
and Size 2 residence halls, which have less
self-selection. In particular, although the
vandalism costs were somewhat higher in
Size 2 residence halls, substantially lower
vandalism costs occurred there than in either
Size 3 or Size 4 residence halls. It might be
argued that Size 2 residence halls provide a
reasonable model to emulate, simply because
most colleges could not afford to provide
enough small residence halls (fewer than 50
students) for an entire campus.
Recommendations
The findings of this study point to the
importance of residence hall size as a
predictor of vandalism. Smaller residence
halls are less likely to produce vandalism.
Although some variables are beyond control
because they are not known in advance (e.g.,
the number of athletes), it is possible to
manage the distribution of gender and class
years across residence halls. The residence
halls should be as balanced as possible in
terms of class year and gender, avoiding
situations where freshmen are more heavily
represented than upperclassmen in mixed
class residence halls. It is also possible to
house students in smaller residence halls (or
to create smaller “houses” within larger
residence halls), to use programming to
encourage less TV viewing and alcohol and
drug use, and to create environments that
emphasize the opportunity for students to get
to know one another and to exchange ideas
with people of varying backgrounds and
opinions, in an effort to foster emotional
maturity. To the extent possible, it is also
suggested that athletes be distributed across
residence halls rather than concentrated in
JULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 515
Vandalism
special housing.
Future researchers should examine the
URES dimensions in relation to an actual
measure of perceived control. Such a
measure would relate residence hall characteristics
and social variables with perceived
control. Additionally, the use of a self-report
measure of vandalism, which could be
related to the verifiable damage charges from
physical plant records, would be informative.
Although the use of verifiable costs establishes
some objectivity, ideally, both objective
and subjective measures could be used.
