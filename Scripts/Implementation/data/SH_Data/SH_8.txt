Factors Associated with Peer Sexual Harassment Victimization Among Taiwanese Adolescents




Abstract 
This study examined the individual and interpersonal
factors of peer sexual harassment victimization among
Taiwanese adolescents. A random sample of 1,376 7th to 9th
grade middle school students in Taichung City, Taiwan,
completed questionnaires about their demographics, delinquency,
peer/teacher interaction, and experience of being
sexually harassed by peers. Approximately 25.4% of the
respondents had suffered peer sexual harassment during the
previous semester. Boys reported more exposure to sexual
harassment than did girls. Multivariate logistic regression
analyses were performed separately for boys and girls.
Significant risk factors of peer sexual harassment victimization
for both genders included being bullied by peers and
teacher maltreatment. Boys’ sexual harassment victimization
was also associated with their involvement in fights. Peer
relationship problems contributed to girls’ sexual harassment
victimization. These findings suggested the relevance of a
hostile school climate to peer sexual harassment and the
gender differences in risk factors.

Introduction
It is well known that students experience various forms of
peer maltreatment at school (see Smokowski and Kopasz
2005, for a review of the issue in U.S. schools). Besides
verbal and physical bullying, many adolescents suffer
frequent humiliation, intimidation, unpleasant touch or
even violent assault of a sexual nature in the educational
environment, which adversely affects their learning and
well-being (e.g., Chiodo et al. 2009). To date, most
investigations on school bullying fail to address this
substantial type of victimization, namely peer sexual
harassment. For example, in a recent comprehensive review
of existing bullying research drawn from several major
academic data bases, only physical, verbal, and relational
forms of student aggression are discussed (Stassen Berger
2007). More importantly, existing research on peer sexual
harassment is largely based on North American (e.g.,
American Association of University Women 2001;
McMaster et al. 2002) and European populations (e.g.,
Timmerman 2003), and the issue receives significantly less
recognition in Asian countries. As an exception, the issue
of sexual harassment on campus has created much public
concern in Taiwan during the past decade (Huang and Bih
2002). After a number of legal cases gained wide publicity,
the Gender Equity Education Act was passed in Taiwan in
2004 to eliminate discrimination, harassment and unwelcome
sexual conduct while providing a safe and genderfriendly
environment for students (Chen 2005). The
legislation specifically requires the government and educational
institutions to develop programs and policies to
address the problem of sexual prejudice and harassment in
school (Chiao 2007). However, relevant data from the local
context remains insufficient, preventing a grounded assessment
of this problem’s prevalence and characteristics.

The present study is among the few attempts to
empirically explore the prevalence and risk factors of
sexual harassment among Taiwanese adolescents, which
adds to the existing knowledge about gender issues in
several ways. First, past studies on sexual aggression and
harassment often assume females to constitute the majority
of victims, and the victimization of males is rarely assessed.
For example, in one study of Canadian young adults’
reaction to hypothetical confrontations of peer sexual
harassment, male undergraduates from a Canadian university
were asked to read scenarios depicting a hypothetical
confrontation by a woman of a male sexual harasser
(Saunders and Senn 2009), while other possibilities were
not fully investigated. A laboratory study of American male
college students examined the predicting factors of gender
harassment, in which gender harassment was defined as the
number of sexist questions asked of women during a mock
job interview or negative evaluations of the female
interviewee (Hitlan et al. 2009). Yet another U.S. study of
the relationship between sexual harassment and empathic
bias examined men’s sexual harassment toward women but
not same-gender targets (Schweinle et al. 2009). However,
as one recent study on the sexual harassment victimization
of U.S. young adults showed, men not only do experience
harassment but such victimizations can impact their
adjustment and maturity outcomes, and a “wimpy male”
hypothesis was discussed by the authors for explanation
(Sears et al. 2011). With a large-scale random sample of
Taiwanese middle school students, this study assessed the
prevalence of peer sexual harassment victimization among
both boys and girls in Taiwan, which is expected to provide
a more accurate picture and advance the current understanding
of this significant gender issue.
The above discussion further suggests the potential
effects of masculinity in peer sexual harassment, and the
present study utilizes the hegemonic masculinity perspective
(Connell and Messerschmidt 2005) as the theoretical
framework for exploring the potentially differential factors
associated with peer sexual harassment between genders.
Like delinquency and violence against women, harassment
is regarded as related to boys’ effort to secure their
manhood and contest for peer status (Messerschmidt
2000), which make themselves to be at high risk of
victimization as well. One study on U.S. young adults
found that, compared to women, men not only perceived
manhood as a more impermanent state than womanhood,
but they also endorsed aggression as a means of proving or
re-establishing threatened manhood (Weaver et al. 2010). At
the same time, as discussed later in the text, peer sexual
harassment victimization is expected to be prevalent among
local adolescents given the classroom structure and cultural
tradition in Taiwan, with peers and teachers to be significant
factors that are often overlooked in past research. To
evaluate the above potential risk factors of peer sexual
harassment, the present study employed multivariate logistic
regression analyses and conducted gender comparison to
empirically test these hypotheses.
Finally, the present study addressed the overrepresentation
of western populations in past research by providing
valuable data from an Asian cultural context that has been
rarely examined before. Having undergone rapid modernization
during the past decades, Taiwan is heavily influenced
by both western culture and its own eastern tradition
(Yang 1996), which constitutes a unique target for investigation.
The traditional Chinese culture in Taiwan has a
strong collectivistic orientation, and everyone’s self is
embedded in social relationships (Yang et al. 2010). One’s
interaction with others is governed by his/her social roles in
a hierarchical network, among which husband-wife is one
of the crucial dyad illustrating gender norms (Jiang 2001).
The Confucian tradition endorses notions such as “men are
superior and women are inferior” and emphasizes submissiveness
and obedience as women’s virtues (Chia et al.
1994). Women are supposed to depend on men while men
are expected to achieve a strong personality and leadership
roles in work and family, which can make them being
assertive and even aggressive (Kao and Lu 2006). Such a
gender ideology is conveyed to Taiwanese youngsters via
family, school and peer group, within which men are taught
to be strong, powerful and tough (Chu 2003; Lee 2007).
Although previous studies have shown increasingly egalitarian
gender roles among local people as a result of
westernization (Chia et al. 1997), sexism remains salient in
Taiwan with its cultural roots (Lee et al. 2007). Such
findings reveal a potential hotbed for sexual harassment to
grow. In fact, existing data highlight the seriousness of the
issue in Taiwan. One survey with a sample of 308 students
from one junior high school in Taiwan showed that 77% of
the students had suffered at least one form of sexual
harassment during their time at the school (Huang and Yen
2004). Another qualitative study on Taiwanese elementary
school students aged 10 and 12 revealed the existence of
verbal and physical sexual harassment among local adolescents
(Chang et al. 2010). In response to this potential
threat to the wellbeing of Taiwanese youth, the present
study aims to promote awareness in the academic community
about the seriousness of the problem in an Asian
context and extend a cross-cultural understanding of sexual
harassment victimization among adolescents.
Prevalence of Peer Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment is generally defined as unwelcome
requests or unacceptable conduct of a sexual nature that
may interfere with one’s life and threaten his/her rights to
employment and education (Lichty et al. 2008). Being
Sex Roles (2012) 66:66–78 67
sexually harassed by peers in educational settings may
result in a variety of negative consequences. One study of
U.S. adolescents found sexual harassment victimization to
be associated with lower self-esteem, poor physical and
mental health, and trauma symptoms (Gruber and Fineran
2008). As one form of peer maltreatment, sexual harassment
is a prevalent experience among adolescents. A
survey of 2,064 U.S. public school students in grades
8 through 12 found that 81% of the students had
experienced some form of sexual harassment at some time
during their school years (American Association of University
Women 2001). One study in the Netherlands of
2,808 randomly selected adolescents aged 14–15 at 22
secondary schools found that 18% of the respondents had
experienced unwanted sexual behavior during the previous
12 months (Timmerman 2003). Another study on 1,734
students from 23 Canadian schools showed that sexualharassment
victimization was common among both boys
(42.4%) and girls (44.1%) in grade 9 (Chiodo et al. 2009).
Using a representative sample of 10,400 students in grades
7 through II from public schools in Israel, one survey found
29.1% of the students were victims of at least one act of
sexual harassment in school during the prior month (Zeira
et al. 2002).
Data on the prevalence of sexual harassment in
Asian countries is relatively limited. Using a large
sample of 4,956 adolescents in Hong Kong, one survey
found that 23% of the primary school students (P.4-P.6)
and 43% of the secondary school students (F.1-F.7) had
ever been sexually harassed or abused by peers (Tang
2004), which highlights the significance of the issue in
Asian contexts.
Boys are found generally more involved in the perpetration
of peer sexual harassment (e.g. American Association
of University Women 2006). Regarding the gender
distribution of the victims in peer sexual harassment, some
studies on U.S. (Hand and Sanchez 2000; Berger and
Rodkin 2009; AAUW 2001; Ormerod et al. 2008) and
Netherlands students (Timmerman 2005) have suggested
that girls experience more frequent and severe peer sexual
harassment than do boys. Other studies on Canadian
(McMaster et al. 2002) and U.S. adolescents (Pellegrini
2001; Gruber and Fineran 2008), however, have shown no
gender difference in victimization prevalence. Yet another
set of studies has found a higher prevalence of
victimization in boys, including one on Israeli public
school students (Zeira et al. 2002) and one on U.S.
adolescents from 5th to 9th grade (Petersen and Hyde
2009). At the same time, studies of Canadian (Williams et
al. 2005) and U.S. students (Gruber and Fineran 2008)
found sexual/gender minority youth at greater risks of
being bullied and sexually harassed. One study specifically
on lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning adolescents
from U.S. high schools revealed the prevalence of
heterosexism and homophobia as well as harassment
toward LGBQ students (Chesir-Teran and Hughes 2009).
However, the above findings are mostly from western
samples, and their applicability to other contexts awaits
further investigation.
Masculinity and Peer Sexual Harassment
Theories of sexual harassment often emphasize its sociocultural
roots and functions. From the hegemonic masculinity
perspective (e.g., Connell and Messerschmidt 2005),
sexual harassment enforces gender hierarchy and status
differential through the humiliation of victims. The issue of
masculinity is particularly salient with regard to sexual
harassment among adolescents. One study of the life
histories of U.S. adolescent male offenders found that the
prevalent masculinity ideology requires young men to be
aggressive, dominant, tough, and to depreciate effeminacy,
which increase their risk of committing harassment and
sexual violence toward women (Messerschmidt 2000).
Another study on African American youth showed that
male adolescents often use physical and verbal sexual
harassment to highlight their power and superiority over
female peers (Miller 2008). It is suggested that such
practices represent a general climate of male dominance
and disrespect toward women in the larger American
society in which schools are embedded (Haywood and
Mac an Ghaill 1996). It is, therefore, tempting to assume
girls to be the major victims of peer sexual harassment.
However, as suggested by researchers in the United States
(Ferguson 2000; Kimmel 1996), the United Kingdom (Mac
an Ghaill 1994), and Australia (Poynting and Donaldson
2005), masculinity should be viewed as an achieved
rather than an ascribed status, and adolescent boys are
in a constant need to contest with each other and prove
their manhood within the male group. One study
conducted in-depth interviews with male students in an
U.S. high school and found the boys’ interaction with
other boys to be characterized by provocative behaviors,
such as teasing, taunting, and mocking of a sexualized
nature (Oransky and Marecek 2009). Another study on
U.S. middle school and high school students revealed that
by ‘feminizing’ other boys through bullying and harassment,
one can bolster his masculinity and gain power
within the peer group (Phillips 2007). Furthermore,
analyses of the male interaction in U.S. schools suggested
that while these peer disciplining practices produce
anxiety, fear and hurt, they also bring friendship, intimacy,
and bonding for the boys (Stoudt 2006; Lyman 1992).
Similarly, it has been shown that hegemonic masculinity
ideology impacts adolescent boys from Pacific Islander
and Asian American backgrounds as well, leading them to
68 Sex Roles (2012) 66:66–78
frequently use violence to enhance their peer status
(Mayeda and Pasko 2011).
The relevance between peer sexual harassment and
masculinity found in the above studies seems to bear a
similarity to the research findings on Taiwanese adolescents.
In an ethnographic study, Guo (2007) described a
common play behavior among Taiwanese male adolescents,
in which a group of boys lifted the victim and hit or rubbed
his reproductive organ against a hard object. This is
recognized as a form of masculine friendship expression
and a reaffirmation of masculinity, although the victim may
feel humiliated and harassed. Taiwanese male adolescents
thus seem to adopt harassment as peer disciplining practice
of masculinity as well, which have a sexualized nature and
inflicts both distress and affiliation on themselves. Another
recent study interviewed Taiwanese juvenile offenders and
found that their masculinity ideologies reflect notions of
toughness, fighting, degrading women, and homophobia
(Hsu 2008). Their life stories revealed that violence and
harassment are common ways for these delinquent youth to
establish their manhood. In addition, a study on Taiwanese
5th grade students showed that the peer group had
crucial influence on male adolescents’ gender ideology
and their interaction with male and female classmates
(Tien 2004). The male students were found to mostly
associate with same-gender peers and their group norms
were characterized by aggressiveness, competition with
other males, and prejudice toward females. The author
observed that besides initiating provocations toward
female classmates, these boys often mock and harass their
more feminine or weak male peers to confirm masculine
norms and gain status within the group. Such practices
resemble the findings from North American youth mentioned
above (e.g., Oransky and Marecek 2009; Phillips
2007) and suggest similarity of the underlying gender
dynamics among male adolescents.
Individual and Interpersonal Risk Factors
Several risk factors of peer sexual harassment in the
individual and interpersonal levels have been identified by
the empirical literature, which lend support to the above
discussion on masculinity dynamics. First, girls are not the
only possible targets of sexual harassment. Boys may also
be sexually harassed by peers in their competition for
masculinity. In a longitudinal study on Canadian high
school students, boys reported receiving more homosexual
slurs or unwanted sexual content, while girls reported
receiving more sexual jokes, comments, and unwanted
touching (Chiodo et al. 2009). One study on U.S. students
further showed that the boys suffered more same-gender
harassment than do girls (Petersen and Hyde 2009). Similar
results were shown by one study on Taiwanese adolescents,
in which not only more boys than girls were found sexually
harassed by peers, but both boys and girls reported “male
classmates or friends” as the perpetrators of harassment
(Huang and Yen 2004). Such findings reveal the potential
high risk of male-to-male harassment among students.
Since Taiwanese adolescents in the middle school years
are shown to interact mostly with same-gender peers (Hsieh
et al. 2006; Tien 2004), and same-gender harassment are
found prevalent among boys (Guo 2007; Tien 2004), it was
hypothesized in this study that Taiwanese middle-school
boys receive more sexual harassment victimization than do
girls.
A major set of individual risk factors associated with
peer victimization and harassment is antisocial behaviors.
One study on U.S. adolescents showed delinquency and
crime to be risk factors of school-based sexual victimization
(Tillyer et al. 2010). As studies on American youth and
adults reveal, themes of aggression, power and “rulebreaking”
are often emphasized in masculinity ideologies
(e.g., Kulis et al. 2010; Walters 2001), and involvement in
these high-risk activities increases one’s likelihood of being
victimized. Delinquency, such as school truancy, substance
use, and other deviant behaviors, is frequently found
associated with victimization among U.S. adolescents
(Gastic 2008; Rusby et al. 2005). In their study of a sample
of 1,532 U.S. high school students, Fineran and Bolen
(2006) suggested a direct relationship between delinquency
(fighting, stealing, and vandalizing property) and peer
sexual-harassment victimization. Lacasse and Mendelson
(2007) surveyed 116 Canadian adolescents in grades
8 through 11 and showed that victims of peer sexual
coercion reported more drug/alcohol use and non-sexual
deviance (starting fights, running away from home, etc.)
than the control group. This again highlighted the close
relationship between the risk of deviance and victimization.
In fact, one study on Taiwanese junior high school
students similarly showed that delinquent behaviors such
as drinking, running away and truancy were associated
with higher risk of sexual harassment/assault victimization
(Hsieh 2007). Since delinquency and violence are more
associated with masculinity rather than femininity, and
such associations are found not only in North American
societies but also in the local context of Taiwan (e.g., Hsu
2008; Bih 2000; Hsu and Cheng 2007), it is expected in
the present study that these factors are more relevant to
Taiwanese boys’ risk of peer sexual harassment victimization
than to girls’ risk.
On the interpersonal level, the risk to victims of peer
maltreatment often lies in their relationship problems with
peers. Studies on U.S. youth showed that lack of friends
and poor peer status were associated with multiple forms of
peer victimization (Wang et al. 2009; Berger and Rodkin
2009; Nansel et al. 2001). In their recent study on
Sex Roles (2012) 66:66–78 69
Taiwanese junior high school students, Wei and Chen
(2009) also found the association between peer rejection
and victimization. At the same time, experiencing school
bullying itself is a risk factor of sexual harassment. Studies
on U.S. adolescents found that the victims of sexual
harassment are likely to be physically and verbally bullied
(Felix and McMahon 2007; Fineran and Bolen 2006).
However, although past research showed that multiple
forms of harassment overlap for both boys and girls, they
may not reflect the same peer issues across gender. As
discussed above, rough treatment is often a masculine way
to express friendship and affiliation between boys as
revealed by studies in the United States as well as Taiwan
(e.g., Reed and Brown 2001; Guo 2007), which does not
equally apply to girls. Boys therefore may be more tolerant
toward such behaviors and less regard themselves as
rejected by peers. Given the existing evidence, it is
hypothesized that the experience of being bullied relates
to both boys’ and girls’ risk of peer sexual harassment but
that girls who are sexually harassed are more likely to
perceive themselves as having peer relationship problems.
Finally, one often overlooked social context in peer
sexual harassment is teacher-student interaction. Maltreatment
by school staff is found associated with student
aggression and sexual harassment among U.S. (Ormerod et
al. 2008) as well as Israeli students (Khoury-Kassabri 2009;
Attar-Schwartz 2009). As significant role models, teachers
can shape students’ attitudes and behaviors toward peers.
One U.K. study showed that school teachers often act as
‘cultural accomplices’ and consolidate the norms of
hegemonic masculinity among adolescents (Smith 2007).
The issue of teacher maltreatment is particularly relevant to
schools in Taiwan due to its Confucian heritage. The local
traditional culture has deep roots in Confucian philosophy,
and it is still influential in shaping the school context and
teacher-student relationship in Taiwan (Tu and Hung 2008;
Yen and Hwang 2011). In educational settings, Confucian
beliefs emphasize hierarchy, obedience and respect for
teachers (Ho and Ho 2008). As a result, teachers in Taiwan
are highly regarded as a parent-like figure and a symbol of
authority whose conduct sets a crucial model for students
to imitate (Fwu and Wang 2002). However, one recent
survey in Taiwan showed that 26.9% of middle school
students reported having been maltreated by teachers at
least once in the previous semester, with hitting, beating or
slapping being the most common maltreatment (Chen and
Wei 2011). More specifically, another study of Taiwanese
junior high school students found the teachers’ harsh
punishment and indifference to students were associated
with higher risk of sexual harassment and assault among
adolescents (Hsieh 2007). It is likely that hostile teacher
treatment serves both as a behavioral example for students
and a contributor for negative school climate, which in turn
increases the tendency of sexual harassment and victimization
among all students, boys and girls alike. The
potential effect of this factor is examined in the present
study.
The Present Study
Peer sexual harassment is a common experience among
adolescents, but it is considerably under-studied compared
to other types of peer maltreatment, not to mention the lack
of extensive research in Asian contexts. This study,
therefore, hopes to bridge the knowledge gap in the existing
literature and provide a large-scale assessment along with
an exploration of the potential risk factors of peer sexualharassment
victimization among adolescents in an Asian
context. Specifically, it aims at testing the following
research hypotheses derived from the literature:
H1 Boys experience higher peer sexual harassment than
do girls.
H2 Delinquent behaviors (getting into fights, theft, and
drinking) are positively associated with sexual harassment
victimization for the boys only.
H3 Peer relationship problems are positively associated
with sexual harassment victimization for girls only.
H4 Being bullied is positively associated with sexual
harassment victimization for both boys and girls.
H5 Experience of teacher maltreatment is positively
associated with sexual harassment victimization for
both boys and girls.
Method
Sample
The Taichung City Youth Life Conditions Survey is a
large-scale survey funded by the Children’s Bureau to
collect information on the life circumstances and service
needs of local adolescents. The present study used the
middle-school dataset of 2006, which consisted of a total
of 1,376 students from 14 public and private middle
schools (grades 7–9) in the area. A two-stage cluster
sampling strategy was employed, in which two schools
were first randomly selected from each of the districts in
Taichung City (except from one district that has no middle
schools). In each of the selected schools, one class from
each grade was subsequently chosen at random to
participate in the study, which resulted in a final sample
of 42 classes. All the students in the classes were included
as participants, with 50.7% (n=698) boys and 49.3%
(n=678) girls. They were fairly evenly distributed over
grades 7–9 (464, 441, and 471 respectively).

Procedure
The project was approved through the internal review
process of the Children’s Bureau and conducted in
accordance with its ethical guidelines. The homeroom
teachers of the selected classes were informed of the study
in summer 2006 and asked to assist in administering the
questionnaire. The survey packs were distributed to
teachers in the middle of the fall semester. Students
completed the self-reported, anonymous inventory in their
classrooms during a regular class period. Instructions were
provided and respondents were explicitly informed that
they were free to withdraw at any time in the process
without any cost. Confidentiality was ensured and the
questionnaires were sealed upon completion in blank
envelopes, which were collected shortly afterward.
Measures
Sexual Harassment
Students’ experience of sexual-harassment victimization by
peers during the last semester was assessed with two items:
“A student made sexual remarks or jokes you did not want”
and “A student touched or caressed you against your will”
(see Appendix). The two items corresponded to the verbal
and physical dimensions of adolescent sexual harassment
identified by past research in Europe (Ortega et al. 2010)
and Taiwan (Chang et al. 2010). A 5-point Likert scale was
provided (never, 1–2 times, 3–4 times, 5–6 times, 7 times or
more). Due to the considerable skewness of the distribution,
the scores on the two items were combined and dichotomized
(r=.38). The binary values were then used in logistic
regression to compare those who did and did not have the
experience.
Gender
The first part of the survey questionnaire inquired about
the respondent’s demographics. Information on student’s
gender was obtained for the present analysis (see
Appendix). Gender was a dichotomous variable (male,
female).
Delinquency
Students were asked whether they had engaged in three
kinds of common delinquent behaviors (getting into
fights, theft, and drinking) during the last year (see
Appendix). Since the original items were dichotomous
(yes/no), the scores on each of the items were used as
separate predictors for sexual harassment victimization in
the regression model.
Peer Relationship Problems
Students were asked whether they had problems in peer
relationships in their daily life (yes/no) (see Appendix). The
item was used as a dichotomous predictor for sexual
harassment victimization in the regression model.
Experience of Being Bullied
Students’ experiences of physical and verbal victimization
by peers during the last semester were measured with 5
items on a five-point scale (never—7 times or more). These
items were adapted from both the school violence scale in
Taiwan and the California School Climate and Safety
Survey (Furlong et al. 2005). The original items were
translated from English to Chinese, followed by a standard
back-translation procedure to ensure translation accuracy.
Items included “Students in school hit you” and “Students
in school threaten you” (see Appendix). The Cronbach
alpha was .72.
Teacher Maltreatment
Four items were used to assess students’ experience of
physical and verbal maltreatment by school teachers during
the last semester (see Appendix). A 5-point Likert scale was
provided (never, 1–2 times, 3–4 times, 5–6 times, 7 times or
more). Items included “Teachers or staff in school hit you”,
“Teachers or staff in school kick you”, and “Teachers or
staff in school say bad words or swear at you” (α=.68).
Results
Overall, 25.4% of the respondents reported ever being
sexually harassed by peers during the previous semester.
26.1% of the boys and 20.4% of the girls had received
sexual remarks or jokes they did not want, while 8.5% of
the boys and 5.3% of the girls had been touched or caressed
against their will (see Table 1). The scores on the two items
were combined and dichotomized to create a composite
measure. As an initial analytic procedure, a MANOVA was
conducted to examine the potential gender differences in all
the continuous variables (see Table 2). Chi-square tests
were also performed for the dichotomous variables (see
Table 3). The overall MANOVA analysis for gender was
found significant (Wilks’ Lambda = .95, F=18.40, p<.01).
It was hypothesized that boys receive higher peer sexual
harassment than do girls (H1), and the results of MANOVA
and chi-square test confirmed the first prediction. Boys
scored higher on verbal and physical sexual harassment
victimization than did girls (F=11.26 and 8.86, p<.01), and
their victimization rate was also significantly higher than
Sex Roles (2012) 66:66–78 71
that of girls (X^2=7.73, df=1, N=1,376, p=.01). In
addition, boys had significantly higher scores than girls on
experience of being bullied and teacher maltreatment
(F=64.90 and 28.52, p<.01). The percentages of boys
having the experiences of getting into fights and theft were
also significantly higher than those of girls. The percentage
of girls having peer relationship problems was significantly
higher than boys, and no significant gender difference was
found in drinking.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed
separately on boys and girls to examine potential gender
differences in the effects of the risk factors. Multicollinearity
diagnosis was computed, and the tolerance and
VIF values indicated no sign of collinearity between the
independent variables. Since the research variables are
conceptually linked and can be grouped into two blocks, a
hierarchical approach was adopted to assess the strength
of the individual- and interpersonal-level factors in a
stepwise manner. The individual-level variables of delinquent
behaviors were entered first, followed by the
interpersonal predictors (peer relationship problems, being
bullied and teacher maltreatment). The results of the final
regression models for boys and girls are summarized in
Table 4. On the individual level, it was hypothesized that
delinquent behaviors were expected to be positively
associated with sexual harassment victimization for boys
only (H2). In partial support of H2, the odds ratio of
getting into fights was significant for boys only (OR=
1.50, p=.05). Theft and drinking were not significantly
associated with sexual harassment victimization for both
genders.
On the interpersonal level, it was hypothesized that peer
relationship problems were associated with sexual harassment
only for girls (H3), which was supported by the
results (OR=1.53, p=.05 for girls and OR=1.09, p=.69
for boys). Finally, experience of being bullied and teacher
maltreatment were both expected to be positively associated
with peer sexual harassment for both genders (H4 and
H5), and the results of logistic regression lent support for
both hypotheses (see Table 4). The Nagelkerke R Squares
of the final regression model for boys and girls were
calculated as both .20.
Discussion
Peer sexual harassment is a common form of victimization
among adolescents. Its negative effects on students’ health
and school adjustment have raised serious public concerns
in recent years. Still, empirical investigation on the issue
remains relatively limited in number, especially in Asian
contexts. This study is likely among the first attempts to
conduct a systematic assessment of peer sexual harassment
in Taiwan with a large-scale, random sample of adolescents.
The results showed that one-fourth of the students (25.4%)
had experienced some sexual harassment during the last
semester. This number is lower than those in some previous
studies mentioned above (e.g., American Association of
University Women 2001; Chiodo et al. 2009). Such a
discrepancy can be partly explained by differences in time
frame adopted and specific behaviors measured. Instead of

1 year or the whole high school years, the present study
specifically asked the respondents about their experience
during last semester and used two items to assess verbal
and physical harassment, while other forms of victimization
of a sexual nature were not examined. Nonetheless, this
prevalence is fairly high and may have a variety of
psychosocial consequences on the well-being and development
of the local students.
The finding that boys reported higher rates of victimization
of both verbal and physical sexual harassment
highlights an often overlooked victim population in sexual
harassment literature. In fact, such results have been
reflected in a number of previous studies discussed above
(Zeira et al. 2002; Petersen and Hyde 2009; Huang and Yen
2004). Since boys are more likely to be the perpetrators of
sexual harassment, it raises the issue of same-gender peer
victimization among boys, which may have different
qualities to cross-gender harassment. In reviewing the
problem of peer sexual harassment in the United States,
Fineran (2002) suggested that masculinity ideology and
heterosexism are evident in these abusive incidents. As a
gendered practice of consolidating social dominance, such
aggression usually happens between same-gender peers.

similarly showed that male students often engaged in
sexualized conversations and physical contact (e.g., dirty
jokes, mock rape, etc.) within the same-gender group (Yang
2007). The present study did not ask respondents about the
gender of their perpetrators, and therefore it is difficult to
separate same-gender and cross-gender harassment. Further
investigation is needed to clarify this issue.
The present study also found that fighting as a
delinquent behavior was related to victimization for boys.
This result echoed certain previous studies on U.S.
adolescents (Fineran and Bolen 2006; Espelage and Holt
2007), suggesting the relevance of delinquency to sexual
harassment victimization. In fact, the overlap of deviant
behaviors and victimization has been long recognized in the
school bullying research done in Netherlands (Veenstra et
al. 2005), South Korea (Schwartz et al. 2002), and Taiwan
(Chen and Astor 2010). As the results of this study showed,
this association is significant only for the boys, which may
be regarded as a negative consequence of confirming
masculine norms. Among the common delinquent behaviors
that include drinking, theft, and fighting, involvement
in fights had the most salient relevance to boys’ sexual
harassment, which makes sense since such aggressive acts
can better express one’s confirmation of hegemonic
masculinity while raising their risk of victimization at the
same time. Although antisocial behaviors such as juvenile
delinquency are means of achieving masculinity for
adolescent boys, some studies on U.S. youth have found
that these strategies may become problematic and get them
into troubles later in adulthood (Sanders 2011; Brown and
Burton 2010).
Unlike youth in many of the western countries, the
middle school students in Taiwan stay in a homeroom with
a fixed group of classmates everyday during their entire
school years. As a result, Taiwanese adolescents are more
often victimized by their classmates than by outside
students (Wei et al. 2007). At the same time, such class
arrangements make peer acceptance and class climate
particularly important contexts for students’ school experience.
The present study showed that self-perceived peer
relationship problem was a significant risk factor for the
girls but not for the boys. It was consistent with the fact that
harassment between males is not necessarily a sign of peer
rejection. Instead, harassment and victimization can be
expressions of friendship and bonding in some circumstances.
Such dynamics do not apply equally to girls’
victimization. One study of U.S. college students found that
men were more likely than women to playfully punch and
shove same-gender friends while women’s playful aggression
often targeted men (Gergen 1990), reflecting the
different meaning of such behaviors. It may be the reason
why girls perceive the acts of harassment as more harmful
and upsetting than do boys (Gruber and Fineran 2008).
In addition, being bullied and suffering teacher maltreatment
were significant risk factors of peer sexual harassment
for both genders. These seemingly diverse kinds of
aggression may reflect unified, underlying dynamics such
as a negative class climate and the existence of an
aggressive culture. The results of this study thus endorsed
the significant effect of a hostile and unfriendly school
environment in adolescents’ risk of being maltreated and
harassed by peers. Research on U.S. adolescents has
suggested the direct and indirect contribution of school
personnel in the perpetration of student victimization and
harassment (e.g., Pellegrini 2002). Furthermore, sexual
harassment by teachers is a potential issue that was not
analyzed in the present study (Timmerman 2003). Teacher
harassment can not only inflict direct harm to the students,
but their misconduct is also likely to promote sexualharassment
between peers. Teachers have a great influence
on the classroom climate and serve as role models for
children. Studies of Taiwanese adolescents showed that
student-teacher relationships and abusive practices by
teachers contribute to students’ aggressive behavior and
delinquency (Chen and Astor 2011; Wei et al. 2010). School
administrators, therefore, may need to pay special attention
to victimization of students by teachers, since it not only
causes direct psychological impact but may also stimulate
peer aggression.
Although this study showed a substantial prevalence of
peer sexual-harassment victimization among Taiwanese
adolescents, the number is better regarded as an underestimation.
Only two kinds of sexual harassment were
assessed, while other forms of gender/sexuality-related
victimization were not included, which is a limitation of
the present study. In particular, the potential vulnerability of
sexual/gender minority students was not assessed. They
often suffer physical, verbal, relational and other forms of
abuse and exclusion at school. Research on U.S. (Huebner
et al. 2004) and Canadian adolescents (Williams et al. 2003)
has shown that gender minorities often experience multiple
forms of peer victimization. The survey battery of this
study contained one item asking whether the respondents
had distress with regard to sexuality. Students who checked
“yes” (n=24) were mostly boys, and they had higher scores
on the two sexual harassment victimization items than their
peers who checked no, which implies the potential impact
of masculinity dynamics. Given the extremely limited
number of cases, no conclusive assertion can be drawn,
but such findings suggest a direction worthy of future
investigation. In addition, the current data is cross-sectional
in nature, and further longitudinal investigations are needed
to evaluate the causality of the variables.
Nonetheless, this study, with its large-scale, random
sample, provides valuable information on the issue of peer
sexual harassment in Taiwan and examines the risk factors
74 Sex Roles (2012) 66:66–78
associated with victimization. A number of studies on
Canadian youth suggested that a heterotypic continuity
exists in an individual’s aggressive behaviors, such as
bullying, sexual harassment, dating aggression, workplace
harassment, domestic violence, and elder abuse (Miller et
al. 2009; Pepler et al. 2006). It is thus crucial to address
minor forms of aggression and victimization in order to
prevent more serious violence and maltreatment. This study
also revealed the effects of school violence on students’ risk
of being sexually harassed. Traditionally, schools have
implemented harsh punishments or interventions targeted
solely at the perpetrators of these incidents. Based on the
findings of this study, it is suggested that attention should
also be put on the victims, as well as the social context of
these incidents. A hostile environment with prevalent
bullying may increase students’ risk of being sexually
harassed. It simultaneously establishes the normality of
violence and affects the victims’ perception of, and
response to, harassment. For example, one study of 1,531
Hong Kong secondary school students showed that the
boys’ own protective behaviors against peer sexual harassment
were strongly affected by their perception of how their
friends would react in the situation (Li et al. 2010). In
addition, the issue of hegemonic masculinity in school
should be addressed. Conflict resolution and social skills
training can be implemented, as well as befriending
programs and a diversity awareness curriculum. Besides
peer support, one Israeli study found assistance from
teachers may also decrease victimization (Marachi et al.
2007). One study on U.S. adolescents found teacher–student
closeness to be associated with a decline in children’s
externalizing behavior, especially for children with the highest
problem levels (Silver et al. 2005). Teachers should establish
themselves as caring and non-abusive role models, creating a
friendly and gender-sensitive classroom climate in an effort
to reduce peer harassment and maintain a safe learning
environment for all students.
