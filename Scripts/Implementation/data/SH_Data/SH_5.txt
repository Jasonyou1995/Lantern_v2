Sexual Harassment in Middle and High School Children and Effects on Physical and Mental Health

Abstract
Sexual harassment can be physical interaction and touching, as well as, psychological, environmental, or via Internet and text messaging. An online survey in an urban clinic asked children, aged 12 to 18 years the following: demographic
data, height and weight, chronic medical conditions, healthcare use, questions concerning sexual harassment—witnessed and exposure, and finally questions from the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-35). Overall, 124 of 210
(59%) of the 12- to 18-year-olds surveyed had experienced sexual harassment, with the predominance being female
69% (80/116) versus 48% (49/92) male. Participants who had experienced sexual harassment were significantly
more likely to score positive for psychological impairment than those who had not experienced sexual harassment
(chi-square test P < .001; odds ratio: 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.8). There was a borderline significant
association between elevated body mass index and having experienced sexual harassment (2-sample t test P = .08).
Sexual harassment has a direct correlation to psychological impairment in adolescents, especially females.

Defining sexual harassment can be challenging, since it
is not only considered physical face-to-face interaction
and touching, it can be psychological, environmental,
and via Internet and text messaging.1
 Since there is no
universal definition and sexual harassment has commonly
been paired with bullying, widely variable rates
of sexual harassment have occurred across studies. In a
recent national survey done by telephone in the United
States in 2011, the respondents of youths aged (10-13
years) and (14-17 years) had experienced sexual harassment
in the past year at rates of 2.8% and 9.3% respectively.2
 However, in studies directly surveying children
and adolescents from fifth grade throughout high
school, who were asked if they experienced some form
of sexual harassment within the past 2 weeks or ever,
the reported rates of sexual harassment varied anywhere
from 15% to 81%.3-5
Some studies have shown females to be much more
likely to experience sexual harassment, and other studies
have shown males and females to have an equal likelihood
of experiencing sexual harassment.2,5 Gender
differences in how a student might experience sexual
harassment have been noted. Females are likely to experience
belittlement and objectification because of their
sex, whereas males experience vulgar and homophobic
comments.6,7 Youth with more advanced pubertal status
are also more likely than their less advanced peers to be
victims of harassment.7,8
Despite the frequency and awareness of sexual
harassment, there is little research found in the pediatric
literature concerning the longitudinal mental and physical
health effects on both male and females as they progress
through school. Goldstein et al8
 reported that sexual
harassment in eighth grade predicted increased problems
with substance use, lower self-esteem, and symptoms
of depression 3 years later. It has also been reported
that sexual harassment can increase school absences,
worsen academic performance, and create mental stress
leading to mental health problems.9
 In addition, sexual
harassment can increase an adolescent’s preoccupation
with appearance and thus increase the risk of developing
eating disorders.10 Chiodo et al11 reported on multiple

Abstract
Sexual harassment can be physical interaction and touching, as well as, psychological, environmental, or via Internet
and text messaging. An online survey in an urban clinic asked children, aged 12 to 18 years the following: demographic
data, height and weight, chronic medical conditions, healthcare use, questions concerning sexual harassment—
witnessed and exposure, and finally questions from the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-35). Overall, 124 of 210
(59%) of the 12- to 18-year-olds surveyed had experienced sexual harassment, with the predominance being female
69% (80/116) versus 48% (49/92) male. Participants who had experienced sexual harassment were significantly
more likely to score positive for psychological impairment than those who had not experienced sexual harassment
(chi-square test P < .001; odds ratio: 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.8). There was a borderline significant

psychosomatic parameters in their longitudinal study
utilizing 12 items from the depression and anxiety subscales
of the Brief Symptom Inventory.12 Their study
showed strong correlations with sexual harassment and
emotional distress, self-harming behaviors, and suicidal
ideation.
Although studies have focused on psychosomatic
complaints related to sexual harassment, few have
looked directly at physical complaints or ailments. It has
been shown that students who are bullied, perhaps a
proxy for sexual harassment, can be affected by poor
physical health. This can be manifested by a variety of
symptoms including headache, backache, abdominal
pain, skin problems, sleeping problems, bed-wetting,
and dizziness.13-17 Some schools consider sexual harassment
as a form of bullying.18,19 Distinguishing between
the 2 terms is important because they have different
definitions and therefore may not have similar longitudinal
outcomes.
Sexual harassment, for our purposes, will be defined
as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which can
include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual
favors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct
of a sexual nature.20,21 This study seeks to specifically
look at sexual harassment in the teenager age population
by (1) assessing the prevalence of sexual harassment
amongst adolescents, who present for well and sick care
at a General Academic Pediatric practice, in a predominantly
urban African American population and (2) determining
whether exposure to sexual harassment correlates
with psychological impairment on the Pediatric
Symptom Checklist-35–Youth Report (Y-PSC-35), and
(3) if exposure to sexual harassment has any effect on
overall body mass index (BMI), increased listing of
chronic illnesses, or increased health care utilization.
Methods
This study applied a questionnaire to adolescents in the
clinic setting to investigate their experiences with sexual
harassment at school and outside of school.
Survey Population
Participants were patients between the ages of 12 and 18
years, scheduled for a well or sick visit in the General
Academic Pediatrics practice located on the main floor
of the Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters, in
Norfolk, Virginia. The patient population is predominantly
African American (85%) with Medicaid or
Medicaid managed care as their primary insurance.
Participation required both—consent from parent or
legal guardian and assent from the adolescent.
Development of the Survey
The online survey tool SurveyMonkey was used to create
the questionnaire used in this study. We included questions
on demographic data (age, sex, grade, and ethnicity);
height and weight; questions on chronic medical
conditions and on the use of health care; questions about
the frequency of sexual harassment witnessed; questions
concerning exposure to sexual harassment from
American Association of University Women,20 and 35
questions from the Y-PSC-35.22 A copy of the full survey
is available on request. Psychological impairment was
defined as any score ≥ 30 on the Y-PSC-35. Participants
were defined as having experienced sexual harassment
if they reported “rare”, “occasional”, “often”, or “very
often” occurrences of at least 1 of the following: (1) I
have been the target of sexual comments, jokes, teasing,
gestures, or looks; (2) I have had my clothing pulled in a
sexual way; (3) I have had sexual rumors spread about
me; (4) I have had my way blocked in a sexual way; (5)
I have been touched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual
way; or (6) I have been shown or given sexual pictures,
photographs, illustrations, messages, or notes.
Survey Administration
We collected data over 2 time periods—from June 2012
through August 2012 and from April 2013 through June
2013. An additional question concerning how the participant
handles exposure to sexual harassment via electronic
and social media was included in the second time
period. Participants completed the survey in the clinic at
the time of their medical appointment using an iPad provided
by the researcher. The research assistant reviewed
all the patients scheduled for the day in the General
Academic Pediatric outpatient area and identified adolescents
that met the study inclusion criteria as they
were being triaged. Once the patient was placed in a
room, the research assistant entered and explained to the
patient and parent/guardian that they are recruiting the
adolescent for an anonymous survey that will ask questions
concerning their experiences with sexual harassment
at school and outside of school. Once the parent/
guardian consented and the adolescent assented to the
study, the survey software was explained and the survey
was completed by the adolescent. A research team member
was present to ensure software functionality and
ensure that there was no parental input in answering the
survey questions. After the final question was completed,
the participant alerted the assistant and the connection
to SurveyMonkey was discontinued (generally
this occurred automatically, but was confirmed by the
assistant).

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and SPSS 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY) software.
Descriptive statistics were reported for the survey
responses, and unknown or missing values were excluded
from the analysis. P values less than .05 were considered
statistically significant. Comparisons of means between
groups were performed using 2-sample t tests. Proportions
were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests,
where appropriate. A logistic regression model for having
experienced sexual harassment assessed the significance
of the relationship with psychological impairment
after adjusting for school level, gender, ethnicity, BMI,
chronic illness, and health care utilization.
Results
Demographics and Medical Conditions
Of the 238 patients approached, 210 (88%) agreed to
participate in this study. Data was not collected on the
27 patients who did not participate. Approximately
89% of the patients surveyed were African American or
multiracial and most were currently in high school
(Table 1). Asthma and allergies were the most common
medical conditions indicated by participants and the
most common interval to visit a doctor was every 6
months (Table 2).
Psychological Impairment
Overall, 39 participants (18.6%) had psychological
impairment as measured by the Y-PSC-35. After excluding
participants with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder), 33 of the 191 participants without ADHD
(17.3%) had psychological impairment (Table 3).
Sexual Harassment
In response to the question “How much do you think
sexual harassment happens in your school?”, 57 (27.5%)
said “It doesn’t happen,” 73 (35.3%) said “It happens to
only a few people,” 38 (18.4%) said “It happens to a fair
number of people,” and 39 (18.8%) said “It goes on all
the time” (Table 4). One hundred five (50.5%) had

witnessed or seen sexual harassment at their school; 68
(32.7%) said they had not, and 35 (16.8%) were not
sure. Overall, 19 (9.2%) had seen or heard of 1 instance
of sexual harassment, 36 (17.5%) said 2 to 5 instances,
44 (21.4%) said 6 or more instances in the past year, and
107 (51.9%) said none/not applicable. One hundred
twenty-four (59.6%) reported that they had experienced
sexual harassment. More specifically, 44 of 92 males
(47.8%) and 80 of 116 females (69.0%) had experienced
sexual harassment. Females were statistically significantly
more likely to have experienced sexual harassment
than males (chi-square test P = .002; odds ratio
[OR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-4.3;
Figure 1). There were no significant differences in having
witnessed or experienced sexual harassment between
African American and Caucasian participants (Fisher’s
exact test, both P > .05).
Psychological Impairment and Sexual
Harassment
Thirty-three of the 124 participants (26.6%) who had
experienced sexual harassment scored positive for psychological
impairment on the Y-PSC-35. Six of the 84
participants (7.1%) who had not experienced sexual
harassment scored positive for psychological impairment.
Participants who had experienced sexual harassment
were statistically significantly more likely to score
positive for psychological impairment than comparable
participants who had not experienced sexual harassment
(chi-square test P < .001; OR = 4.7; 95% CI = 1.9-11.8;
Figure 2). A logistic regression model was used to determine
that this relationship remained significant after
adjusting for school level, gender, ethnicity, BMI,
chronic illness, and health care utilization (P = .048; OR =
2.9; 95% CI = 1.0-8.5; Table 5).
After excluding participants with ADHD, 30 of the
113 participants (26.6%) who had experienced sexual
harassment scored positive for psychological impairment.
Three of the 76 participants (4.0%) who had not
experienced sexual harassment scored positive for psychological
impairment. After excluding participants
with ADHD, those who had experienced sexual harassment
remained statistically significantly more likely to
score positive for psychological impairment than were
comparable participants who had not experienced sexual
harassment (N = 189; chi-square test P < .001; OR =
8.8; 95% CI = 2.6-30.0). Conversely, the Y-PSC-35
symptoms were not made worse by the combination of
ADHD with sexual harassment (Fisher’s exact test, all P
> .05), but this negative finding is most likely because of
a lack of power given the small number of subjects with
ADHD (n = 19). This analysis compared the Y-PSC-35
responses (“never” vs “sometimes” or “often”) for participants
with ADHD who had experienced sexual

who had not experienced sexual harassment. There was
a borderline statistically significant association between
BMI and having experienced sexual harassment (2-sample
t test P = .08). Ninety of 143 participants (62.9%)
with a chronic disease had experienced sexual harassment,
and 34 of 65 participants (52.3%) without a
chronic disease had experienced sexual harassment.
There was, however, no association between having a
chronic illness (or each individual illness) and having
experienced sexual harassment (chi-square or Fisher’s
exact test, all P >.05). In addition, there was no association
between health care utilization and having experienced
sexual harassment (chi-square test P =.37).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that females in middle and high
school are more likely to be sexually harassed than
males. Although recent studies have shown equal sexual
harassment in males and females,11our study mirrors
many of the findings in Goldstein et al8
 and Nadeem et
al,23 where African American females were more likely
to be harassed and more likely to have negative psychological
outcomes from exposure. This current study also
suggests that there may be differences in the pattern of
sexual harassment based on a child’s ethnicity and
socioeconomic class.
Our study reinforces the fact that exposure to sexual
harassment can affect the emotional well-being of a
child. The data clearly show a correlation for adolescents
who experienced sexual harassment to be more
likely to have a positive score on the Y-PSC-35.
Although the Y-PSC-35 is not a screen that can provide
an avenue to a specific diagnosis, data from previous
studies show that 67% of children or adolescents with a
positive score will have a moderate to severe impairment
in psychosocial functioning with the other 33%
with a positive score having at least a mild impairment,
and all would likely benefit from more specific mental
health testing.24,25
Although the mean BMI had SD that overlapped for
those who had experienced sexual harassment (25.22 ±
6.46) and those who had not experienced sexual harassment
(23.74 ± 4.99), there was a borderline statistically significant
association with the 2-sample t test yielding a P
value of .08. This may be related to the possibility that
females who are heavier may have started their pubertal
growth spurts earlier and this may have made them targets
for harassment, or perhaps after being harassed they may
have been more likely to eat for comfort from being emotionally
distraught. There does not appear to be any correlation
with sexual harassment and any chronic underlying
Figure 1. Student responses to whether they had
experienced sexual harassment stratified by gender (N = 208).

illnesses such as ADHD, diabetes, or asthma. There also
did not appear to be an increased use of health care via
more primary care visits, emergency department, or subspecialty
visits. Interestingly, the question added in our second
wave of data collection concerning, “what action taken
after you were harassed?” approximately two thirds of the
respondents answered “nothing” and only 25% spoke with
a parent, teacher, or counselor (Table 6).
Limitations
There is no preassessment data prior to middle school to
determine if symptoms verified by the Y-PSC-35 existed
prior to middle school. Correlation does not always
mean causation, and children who are harassed may be
preyed upon because of existing psychological disorders.
Our data may not be generalizable because it is
only from one primary care office but does provide
intriguing data that could be replicated in a larger study.
Unfortunately, our health indicators and health care utilization
were by report and could not accurately be
cross-referenced to the personal medical records in the
study. There was 88% participation; however data was
not collected on the 28 patients who did not participate.
It is impossible to predict if they did not participate
because they were concerned about talking about previous
harassment or if they would have been less likely to
have been victims of sexual harassment. Obviously
there is overlap between bullying, physical intimidation,
and sexual harassment. We did not collect data on specific
antibullying campaigns within the schools that the
participants’ attended and this may have affected overall
prevalence and recall, since some data was collected
during the school year and some was collected during

antibullying programs have only shown small to moderate
effects on victimization.26
Conclusions
Sexual harassment appears to have a direct correlation
to psychological impairment in adolescents, especially
females. Although it did not reach statistical significance,
there was an elevated BMI in children who had
been sexually harassed; however, no other chronic disease
or health care utilization appears to be effected in
our cohort. The plausible relationship between elevated
BMI and sexual harassment should be studied further. In
addition, children who were harassed were not likely to
do or say anything about that harassment. Pediatricians
therefore should ask specific questions about sexual
harassment during their adolescent health care visits
commonly known as the HEADDSS (Home, Education/
Employment, Activities, Diet, Drugs, Sexuality, and
Suicide/Depression) assessment.27 If questions concerning
sexual harassment are affirmative, then the physician
should consider further screening for mental health
and/or psychosomatic concerns.
