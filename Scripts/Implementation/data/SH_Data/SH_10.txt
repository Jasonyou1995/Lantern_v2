Sexual harassment among adolescents of different sexual orientations and gender identities




Abstract
This article examines (a) variation in rates of sexual harassment acrossmode (e.g., in-person,
online) and type of harassment, (b) the impact of sexual harassment (i.e., distressing vs.
non-distressing), and (c) how sexual harassment is similarly and differently experienced
across sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Data were collected as part of the
Teen Health and Technology online survey of 5,907 13 to 18 year-old Internet users in the
United States. Past year sexual harassment was reported by 23–72% of youth, depending
upon sexual orientation, with the highest rates reported by lesbian/queer girls (72%), bisexual
girls (66%), and gay/queer boys (66%). When examined by gender identity, transgender
youth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment – 81%. Overall, the most common
modes for sexual harassment were in-person followed by online. Distress in the form of
interference with school, family, and/or friends; creating a hostile environment; or being
very/extremely upset was reported by about half of the sexually harassed bisexual girls and
lesbian/queer girls, 65% of the gender non-conforming/other gender youth, and 63% of the
transgender youth. Youth with high social support and self-esteem were less likely to report
sexual harassment. Findings point to the great importance of sexual harassment prevention
for all adolescents, with particular emphasis on the unique needs and experiences of
youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that
emphasize self-esteem building could be particularly beneficial for reducing the likelihood
of victimization and lessen the impact when it occurs.

Introduction
Sexual harassment is associated with a variety of negative psychosocial and physical health concerns, including emotional
distress, self-harming behavior and suicidal ideation, substance use, and physical violence in and outside of dating
relationships (Chiodo, Wolfe, Crooks, Hughes, & Jaffe, 2009a; Gruber & Fineran, 2007). This significant adolescent health
issue is common in adolescence. One national survey suggested 2.8% of youth (ages 10–13) and 9.3% of youth (ages 14–17)
in the United States were sexually harassed in the past year; 15.8% of 14 to 17 year-olds report ever experiencing sexual
harassment (Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2013). Higher rates were reported as part of the American Association
of University Women (AAUW) survey in 2001: 81% of students experienced some form of sexual harassment during their

school years (AAUW, 2001). A longitudinal study of 5th, 7th, and 9th graders in Wisconsin found past year rates of peer sexual
harassment victimization increases with age from 38% of 5th grade girls to 78% of 9th grade boys (Petersen & Hyde, 2009).
The Definition of Sexual Harassment
Because of diverse legal, sociological, feminist, and psychological perspectives, a universal definition of sexual harassment
does not exist (McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2002), and thus, rates of sexual harassment vary widely across studies.
As with any form of victimization, types of sexual harassment range from minor forms, such as sexual jokes and comments,
to severe forms, including sexual assault. The legal definition requires the harassment to create a hostile environment (U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, n.d.). Sexual harassment is not limited to face-to-face interactions; indeed,
such victimization can also occur through the Internet and text messaging (Barak, 2005; Ybarra, 2003; Ybarra, Espelage, &
Mitchell, 2007; Ybarra, Mitchell, & Korchmaros, 2011).
In the current study, we take a broad approach to ensure we are capturing all possible forms of sexual harassment. We
define sexual harassment as unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and sexual comments or gestures that
occur in any environment.
The Importance of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth seem to be particularly at risk for sexual harassment: 71% of gay,
lesbian, bisexual, and questioning middle and high school students in the northeastern United States reported being sexually
harassed during the school year compared to 32% of their heterosexual counterparts (Gruber & Fineran, 2008). A metaanalysis
of the victimization experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (adolescents and adults) across 386 studies
between 1992 and 2009 found 50% of LGB individuals in the United States experienced sexual harassment (Katz-Wise & Hyde,
2012). Among Canadian adolescents, sexual minority and questioning youth were also more likely than heterosexual youth
to be victims of peer sexual harassment (Williams, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2003). Similar findings have been documented
by other researchers (Fineran, 2001; Williams, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2005).
Biological sex also seems to play a role in risk for sexual harassment. Females experience sexual harassment differently
from males (Chiodo et al., 2009a) and more frequently: 13.6% of females ages 14–17 years reported past year sexual harassment
compared to 4.7% of their male counterparts among a national sample of youth in the United States; lifetime rates were
21.2% for adolescent females and 10.8% for adolescent males (Finkelhor et al., 2013). Females are more likely to be put down,
objectified, or treated differently because of their sex (Lindberg, Grabe, & Hyde, 2007), whereas males are more likely to
experience vulgar and homophobic comments (McMaster et al., 2002). Females also experience more of the physical forms
of sexual harassment (e.g., touched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual way; intentionally brushed up against in a sexual way)
than males (American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Ontario Secondary School Teacher
Federation, 1995).
Despite research that suggests biological sex is influential in understanding sexual harassment, there is a noted paucity
of research exploring the experiences of youth across gender identities and among youth who identify as transgender in
particular. Gender identity, including transgender, is different than sexual orientation: It is the knowledge of oneself as being
male or female. Transgender youth feel themselves to be of a gender different from their biological sex, which is separate
from one’s sexual orientation (i.e., gay, lesbian, heterosexual, or bisexual). Although data are lacking for sexual harassment
specifically, research on other forms of victimization support the hypothesis that transgender youth may be at heightened
risk. For example, compared to male and female gender LGB youth, transgender youth are even more likely to be physically
harassed and assaulted (Greytak, Kosciw, Diaz, & Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, 2009; Grossman & D’Augelli,
2006; Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012; McGuire, Anderson, Toomey, & Russell, 2010). Ninety percent
of transgender students heard derogatory remarks, such as “dyke” or “faggot” in school at least sometimes during the past
year; 90% heard negative remarks about someone’s gender expression (Greytak et al., 2009). More than half of transgender
youth have been physically harassed and more than one-quarter physically assaulted because of their gender expression or
sexual orientation (Greytak et al., 2009). Illustrating how these data relate to sexual harassment more specifically among
this population needs to be a priority for adolescent health research.
The Impact of Sexual Harassment
Little is known about how sexual harassment may affect one’s daily life, particularly for LGBT youth. Data from college
students suggests that LGBT young people aremore deeply affected by the experience (Hill & Silva, 2005). Theymay feel angry,
afraid, less confident, or more self-conscious and be dissatisfied with their college experience. Adolescent health research
about other types of peer victimization suggest that LGBT youth report greater disruptions in educational trajectories as a
result of their experiences (Collier, van Beusekom, Bos, & Sandfort, 2013). We need to better understand how many young
people experience disruptions in their daily functioning, including relationships with family and friends, and the ability
to continue to feel able to navigate the world safely. Identifying factors – both risk (e.g., depressive symptomatology) and
protective (e.g., self-esteem) – that help explain one’s vulnerability to this interference also is critical.
282 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280–295
Understanding Protective Factors for Sexual Harassment
Supportive and accepting individuals in a LGBT adolescent’s life can play a protective role reducing harmful effects of
victimization and other risk factors (Anhalt & Morris, 1998). Evidence has emerged that suggests protective factors, such as
family connectedness and supportive adults, are not only associated with lower levels of risk for mental health problems and
suicidal ideation but also mitigate the negative relationships between victimization and risk (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006).
Not all LGBT youth have access to social support, however. Less than half (45.7%) of LGBT youth report that they have a
student club in their school that addresses LGBT student issues. And youth who attended a high school with a gay-straight
alliance (GSA) had less alcohol use, less depression symptoms, and less generalized psychological distress compared with
youth without a GSA in their high school (Heck, Flentje, & Cochran, 2011). Sexual minority adolescents have more difficulties
in getting along with peers, teachers, and parents (Ueno, 2005). Among a community-based high school sample of LGBQ
adolescents, sexual minority youth reported less social support from both peers and family members than their heterosexual
counterparts (Williams et al., 2005). This study also found that more social support was related to less victimization (i.e.,
bullying, sexual harassment, and physical abuse by peers) and less externalizing and depressive symptoms.
Self-esteem is also critical for the well-being of LGBT youth. Research suggests that for LGBT youth, school victimization
was related to lower self-esteem (Russell, Ryan, Toomey, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2011). Further, students who experience higher
levels of victimization (i.e., harassment, assault in school) based on their sexual orientation or gender expression have lower
levels of self-esteem than those who report lower levels of the same types of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012). Findings
from the current study will add an important piece to the existing literature on the potential protective influences of social
support and self-esteem for buffering the impact of sexual harassment among all youth, and LGBT youth in particular.
Additional Factors Missing from the Literature
Technology is now an integral part of the lives of adolescents. Use of the Internet by teens between the ages of 12 and 17
in the United States has increased from 73% in 2000 to 95% in 2012 (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2013). Moreover,
in 2012, 74% of teens had mobile access to the Internet and 25% accessed the Internet mostly from their cell phone. Even with
this widespread use of the Internet among youth, little is known about how youth experience sexual harassment through
technology. The limited data that does exist suggests a substantial percentage of youth (about 1 in 6) in the United States
report unwanted sexual experiences (i.e., someone trying to get me to talk about sex when I did not want to; someone
asked me to do something sexual when I did not want to) via the Internet in a given year (Ybarra, Mitchell, & Espelage,
2012; Ybarra et al., 2011). Whether sexual minority youth experience sexual harassment through technology differently
from heterosexual youth has yet to be explored.
Intimate and sexual relationships are normative, age-typical tasks for adolescents and these relationships have signifi-
cant implications for health, adjustment, and psychosocial functioning (Bouchey & Furman, 2003; Collins, 2003). A healthy
romantic relationship is related to a positive self-concept (Connolly & Konarski, 1994) and the development of important
interpersonal skills such as sharing, negotiation, disclosure, and intimacy (Feiring, 1996; Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Given
how central dating and sexual behavior is in the lives of adolescents, and the inherent sexual nature of the harassment
experiences under study, it is important to take into account adolescent’s dating and sexual experiences when exploring
factors related to sexual harassment.
Hypotheses
To address these identified gaps in the literature, we will examine differences in sexual harassment rates and impact (i.e.,
distressing vs. non-distressing) by mode of harassment (e.g., online, in person), type of harassment (e.g., made obscene or
sexual comments), youth behavior (e.g., dating and sexual activity), and protective factors (e.g., social support, self-esteem).
We also examine how these rates are similar and different across sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Based upon
school and adult data, we posit that LGBT youth will report higher rates of sexual harassment across modes; and that the
impact will be more severe among these youth.
Method
Participants
Teen Health and Technology (THT) survey data were collected from August 4, 2010, to January 17, 2011, from 5,907
13 to 18 year-olds in the United States. The survey protocol was reviewed and approved by the Chesapeake Institutional
Review Board (IRB), the University of New Hampshire IRB, and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN)
IRB. We received a waiver of parental consent to protect youth who would be potentially placed in harm’s way if their sexual
orientation was unintentionally disclosed to their caregivers.
Sample size challenges because of low base rates of LGBT youth (Kann et al., 2011) make it difficult to randomly select
a national, representative sample of children and adolescents 18 years of age and younger which is large enough to draw
statistically valid conclusions. For example, a population-based study of adolescents, 13 to 18 years old (Harris Interactive &
K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280–295 283
Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network [GLSEN], 2005), has shown that about 5% of this population identify as lesbian,
gay, or bisexual. The THT study was designed particularly to address this limitation. Participants were recruited from two
sources: (a) the Harris Poll Online (HPOL) opt-in panel (n = 3,989 respondents) and (b) referrals from GLSEN (n = 1,918
respondents).
The HPOL and GLSEN samples differed in some expected ways, even after taking into account weighting. The HPOL
sample was significantly more likely to be heterosexual (75% vs. <1%), younger (45% were ages 13–15 compared to 39% of
the GLSEN sample), White race (68% vs. 63%), and live in a small town or rural area (40% vs. 33%). GLSEN participants were
more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (23% vs. 19%) and female gender (61% vs. 52%). We see age differences in ways we
would expect because of typical sexual development whereby one becomes increasingly aware of one’s sexual self, including
sexual orientation, with age. The differences in ethnicity and race were not clinically significant but statistically significant
because of the large sample size. The noted differences in type of community were expected given the stigma associated
with being a sexual minority, particularly in smaller communities.
Procedures
The survey was self-administered to all participants online. Qualified respondents were defined as (a) U.S. residents, (b)
ages 13 to 18, (c) in 5th grade or above, and (d) assented or consented to participate in the survey. The median survey length
was 23 min for HPOL respondents and 34 min for GLSEN respondents.
HPOL respondents were invited through password-protected email invitations to participate in a survey about their
online experiences. A stratified random sample of U.S. residents was identified among four groups of HPOL members: (a) 13
to 18 year-olds, (b) adults with a 13 to 17 year-old in their household, (c) adults with a child under 18 in their household,
and (d) a general population of adults. Invitations to HPOL adults noted that the survey was intended for a 13 to 18 year old
in the household and asked the adult to forward the survey link to the teen.
An oversample of LGBT teenagers was recruited into the study through GLSEN’s referral efforts. GLSEN is the leading
national education organization focusing on ensuring safe schools for all youth, regardless of sexual orientation or gender
identity (www.glsen.org). GLSEN works to educate teachers, students, and the public about the negative impact of homophobia
and heterosexism on a healthy school environment for youth. Most GLSEN referral respondents were recruited through:
(a) emails sent with the survey link to GLSEN’s distribution list and (b) publicizing the survey through targeted advertising
on Facebook.
The response rate for the HPOL sample was calculated as the number of individuals who started the survey divided by
the number of email invitations sent less any email invitations that were returned as undeliverable. The survey response
rate, 7.2%, is within range of other recent national Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, &
Zickuhr, 2010; Mitchell, Jones, & Wolak, 2011), even though the response rates of telephone surveys typically appear higher
than online response rates because it is impossible for online surveys to determine if the email has reached the intended
recipient’s inbox (as opposed to being filtered out by spam filters), and individuals who have not “picked up” their email.
The response rate for the GLSEN sample cannot be calculated as the denominator is indeterminable.
Weighting procedures were used so that the data would behave as if they were nationally representative and to align
the two samples so that they could be combined into one dataset. Propensity weighting is a well-established statistical
technique that, when applied to data, minimizes the issue of nonrandomness based on known covariates and establishes
equivalency for those who are in the sample versus not because of self-selection bias (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984; Schonlau
et al., 2004; Terhanian & Bremer, 2000). HPOL data are consistently comparable to data that have been obtained from
random telephone samples of the general populations once propensity weighting and appropriate sample weights are
applied (Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2003; Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2004;
Schonlau et al., 2004; Terhanian, Siegel, Overmeyer, Bremer, & Taylor, 2001). (See Ybarra, Mitchell, Kosciw, Korchamaros, &
Diener-West, submitted for publication for more details about propensity score weighting in this study.)
Measures
Sexual orientation. Sexual orientation was measured with the following question: “Below is a list of terms that people
often use to describe their sexuality or sexual orientation. How would you describe your sexuality or sexual orientation?
Please select all that apply.” Response options included: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Straight/heterosexual, Questioning, Queer, Other,
or Not Sure.
Because youth were allowed to endorse multiple options, mutually exclusive categories were created at the data cleaning
stage so that analyses could compare youth across sexual orientation categories. Responses were categorized based upon
the following hierarchy: Gay/Lesbian, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, and Straight/Heterosexual. Thus, as an example, if an
individual identified as gay and queer, they were categorized as Gay/Lesbian; if an individual identified as bisexual and
questioning, they were categorized as Bisexual.
Gender identity. Gender identity was measured with the following question: “What is your gender? Your gender is how
you feel inside and can be the same or different than the answer you gave [when you were asked about your biological sex].”
Response options were male, female, transgender, or other (specify). Multiple response options were possible.
284 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280–295
For the purposes of the current paper, we looked at a combination of sexual orientation-gender identities among youth
with the same biological sex and gender identities (termed cisgender) and gender identity separately. To examine sexual
orientation-gender identity we classified youth into eight groups: (a) Heterosexual boys, (b) Heterosexual girls, (c) Bisexual
boys, (d) Bisexual girls, (e) Questioning boys, (f) Questioning girls, (g) Gay/queer boys, and (h) Lesbian/queer girls. The
analytic sample for analyses based on sexual orientation-gender identity was 5,139 as it was restricted to cisgender youth.
There was insufficient sample size to allow for categorization of transgender youth by sexual orientation. Therefore, in a
separate analysis, we focused on gender identity; youth were classified into four groups: (a) Cisgender males, (b) Cisgender
females, (c) Transgender, and (d) Gender non-conforming or other gender. The analytic sample for analyses based on gender
identity was 5,498.
Sexual harassment. We measured sexual harassment in two separate ways: mode and type. To measure sexual harassment
by mode, youth were presented with the following text: “Next we have a few questions about sexual harassment.
We say that sexual harassment includes: unwanted sexual advances, unwanted requests for sexual favors, someone saying
something or doing something sexual when you do not want them to. Sexual harassment can happen anywhere, like at
school, at home, or other places you hang out. In the past 12 months, how often have you been sexually harassed...? (a)
In-person, (b) By phone call (on a cell phone or landline), (c) By text message, (d) Online, and (e) Some other way.” Response
options were every day or almost every day, once or a few times a week, once or a few times a month, once of a few time in
the past 12 months, never in the past 12 months. A positive response to any of the above modes was indicative of any sexual
harassment in the past year by mode.
To measure sexual harassment by type youth were asked: “In the past 12 months, how often have you been sexually
harassed in the following ways? Remember that these things can happen anywhere, including in-person, online, and by text
messaging. Nine different types of sexual harassment were provided: (a) Someone spread sexual rumors or wrote sexual
messages about me in a public place such as the bathroom walls, in locker rooms, etc.; (b) Someone touched, grabbed, or
pinched me or grabbed my clothing in a sexual way when I did not want them to; (c) Someone intentionally brushed up
against me in a sexual way when I did not want them to; (d) Someone blocked my way or cornered me in a sexual way
when I did not want them to; (e) Someone made sexual or obscene comments that I did not want to hear; (f) Someone
showed or sent me sexual or obscene messages or pictures when I did not want to see them; (g) Someone asked me for
sexual information about myself when I did not want to tell them (really personal questions, like sexual things I have done
or what my body looks like); (h) Someone asked me to do something sexual when I did not want to; and (i) I was sexually
harassed in some other way.” Response options were the same as those provided by sexual harassment by mode. A positive
response to any of the nine items was indicative of any sexual harassment in the past year by type.
Taken together, a positive response to any mode or type was coded as experiencing sexual harassment in the past 12
months.
Distress. Youth who reported at least one sexual harassment episode by either mode or type were asked a series of
follow-up questions to determine the impact of the experience. We did not query distress for each mode or type to reduce
respondent burden. First, youth were asked, “Think about the places where you were sexually harassed in the past 12 months,
do any of these places now feel scary, unfriendly, or uncomfortable?” Response options were yes/no. Next, youth were asked
how much being sexually harassed interfered with (a) Your (school) work or other responsibilities, (b) Your relationships
with friends, and (c) Your relationships with family members. Response options were: Not at all, Not very much, Somewhat,
and A lot. Responses were coded as a lot/somewhat versus other. We then asked youth to “Think about the time you were
sexually harassed that you remember the most. How did you feel when it happened?” Response options were measured on
a 5-point scale ranging from not at all upset to extremely upset; and coded as very/extremely upset versus all other responses.
Demographic characteristics. Age was coded as 13 to 15 years, 16 to 17 years, and 18 years old because of high collinearity
with some of the psychosocial characteristics and sexual activities. Household income was measured: “How would you
describe your family’s income?” Youth had three options: Lower than average, About average, and Higher than average. Those
who indicated their income was lower than average were compared to all other youth. Region was measured by asking
where the respondent’s school was located: In an urban or city area, In a suburban area next to a city, or In a small town or
rural area. Youth reported their race (coded as White vs. other) and ethnicity (coded as Hispanic vs. other).
Additional covariates. To measure dating, youth were asked how many romantic relationships they had in the past 12
months with someone they would call a boyfriend or a girlfriend. To measure sexual activity, youth were first asked whether
they had ever had consensual oral sex (“Have you ever had oral sex [we mean stimulating the vagina or penis with the mouth
or tongue] when you wanted to?”), penetrative sex (“Have you ever had sex with another person that involved a finger or
sex toy going into the vagina or anus when you wanted to?”), vaginal sex (“Have you ever, when you wanted to, had sex
where a penis went into a vagina?”), and anal sex (“Have you ever, when you wanted to had sex where someone’s penis
went into your anus?” “Have you ever, when you wanted to had sex where your penis when into someone’s anus?”). All
youth who had oral, vaginal, or anal sex in the past 12 months were then asked, “How many people have you had any type
of sex with in the past 12 months when you wanted to? By sex we mean oral sex or sex where a penis, finger, or sex toy goes
into the vagina or anus.” Number of romantic relationships and sex partners were each coded as none, one, or two or more.
Indication of depressive symptomatology was measured with a sum variable of the 10 items from the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale – Revised (CESD-R; ˛= .93). This scale asks respondents to report how often they have felt,
e.g., like a bad person. Response options included not at all or less than 1 day in the last week; 1–2 days in the last week; 3–4
days in the last week; 5–7 days in the last week; and nearly every day in the last week. Respondents were coded to reflect having
K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280–295 285
major depression (i.e., five or more symptoms all day, nearly every day for the past two weeks, one of which is anhedonia
or dysphoria; and functional impairment at home, with friends, or at school (1) versus not having major depression (0).
Two aspects of the parent–child relationship were queried: Emotional bond (e.g., how well do you get along?; 3 items:
˛= .75) and Coercive discipline (e.g., how often does your caregiver spank or slap you; 3 items: ˛= .56). These two subscales
were modified from the Youth Internet Safety Survey (Ybarra, Mitchell, Wolak, & Finkelhor, 2006). Each aspect was reflected
by a sum score of youth responses to the subscale items for the corresponding subscale, with a higher score reflecting a
worse relationship. For both variables, the continuous variables were highly collinear with other psychosocial variables in
the model. As such, they were dichotomized to reflect scores one standard deviation above the mean and higher versus all
other scores.
Social support was measured as a summation of four items from the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support
(˛= .94; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). These items asked respondents to think about their friends who they first
met in-person, not online, and to report how much they agree (very strongly disagree to very strongly agree) that they can
talk about their problems with these friends, can share their happy and sad moments with these friends, can count on these
friends when things go wrong, and these friends really try to help them. Responses across items were summed so that larger
values reflect greater support from offline friends and then coded to reflect scores two standard deviations above the mean
and higher (1) versus all other scores (0). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1965); ˛= .93.
This scale asks respondents to report how much they agree or disagree that, e.g., I certainly feel useless at times. Response
options ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Responses were coded so that larger values reflected greater selfesteem,
were summed across items, and then coded to reflect scores one standard deviation above the mean and higher (1)
versus all other scores (0).
Data Analyses
Using Stata/SE 11.2 (StataCorp, 2009), data were imputed usingmultiple imputation. Respondents who gave valid answers
(i.e., not do not know answers) for less than 80% of the survey or those who did not meet valid data requirements (i.e., survey
length was less than 5 min; self-reported age at the beginning and end of the survey differed by more than a year) were
dropped. The final sample size was 5,542.
First, we examined how many youth reported sexual harassment victimization by sexual orientation-gender identity and
then by gender identity. We also estimated how many youth reported sexual harassment victimization by specific modes
(e.g., in-person, online) and types for youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Next, we explored how
often and in what ways sexual harassment resulted in distress, both by sexual orientation and gender identity. We used chisquare
tests, corrected for survey weights (i.e., Design-based F statistics), to measure statistical differences between youth
of different sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Two multinomial logistic regressions were used to estimate the
odds of non-distressing and distressing sexual harassment (with no sexual harassment as a reference group) given a number
of risk and protective factors suggested in the literature. All independent variables were entered at the same time into the
models. We first focused on differences across sexual orientation-gender identity groups, and then focused on differences
across gender identity groups. Conditional odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported for each. The models were
adjusted for survey process measures: Self-reported honesty in answering survey questions, and completion of the survey
alone or with other people in the room irrespective of statistical significance.
Results
Rates and Impact of Sexual Harassment by Sexual Orientation-Gender Identity
Rates of past year sexual harassment varied significantly when examined by sexual orientation (Table 1). Lesbian/queer
girls reported the highest rates of past year sexual harassment (72%) across mode and type, followed by bisexual girls (66%)
and gay/queer boys (66%). Heterosexual boys reported the lowest rate (23%). Information about individual modes and types
of sexual harassment is detailed in Table 1. Across all sexual orientation groups, youth most commonly reported being
sexually harassed in-person and online; they most frequently reported experiencing harassment in the form of obscene or
sexual comments and being asked for sexual information. Overall rates of sexual harassment were higher when queried by
type rather than mode.
Youth were impacted differently by the sexual harassment experiences. Distress included being very or extremely upset
because of the harassment; interference with school work or other responsibilities, relationships with friends, and relationships
with family; and feeling like the harassment resulted in a hostile environment (places felt scary, unfriendly or
uncomfortable). Over half (54%) of lesbian/queer girls and bisexual girls (52%) reported some type of sexual harassmentrelated
distress (Table 1). Heterosexual boys reported the least distress (33%). As shown in Table 2, all sexual orientation
groups were more likely to experience any sexual harassment and distressing sexual harassment in comparison to heterosexual
boys. Gay/queer boys, lesbian/queer girls, and bisexual girls were particularly likely to report elevated rates.

Rates and Impact of Sexual Harassment by Gender Identity
Past year prevalence rates of sexual harassment victimization significantly varied by gender identity (see Table 3). Transgender
youth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment (81%), followed by gender non-conforming/other gender youth
(69%). About half (52%) of youth identifying as female reported sexual harassment as did 34% of youth identifying as male.
These patterns held for sexual harassment by mode (e.g., online, in person) and by type (e.g., obscene or sexual comments,
asked to do something sexual).
Male youth reported significantly less distress than all other groups (37%). The other groups reported distress between 47%
(female youth) and 65% (gender non-conforming youth). All groups of youth reported elevated odds of distressing and nondistressing
sexual harassment in comparison to male gendered youth (see Table 2). Compared to male youth, the elevated
odds of harassment-related distress were highest for youth who identified both as transgender and gender non-conforming
(see Table 2).
Other Characteristics Related to Sexual Harassment Victimization
As shown in Table 4, risk factors bivariately related to increased odds of both distressing and non-distressing sexual
harassment included: Having at least one romantic partner in the past 12 months, at least one sex partner in the past
12 months, high depressive symptomatology, high caregiver coercive behavior, and a poor emotional bond with one’s
caregiver. High self-esteem was protective against distressing and non-distressing sexual harassment; high social support
was protective against distressing harassment. Lower than average income and Hispanic ethnicity were positively related
to distressing harassment. Other demographic characteristics were not statistically significantly related to either type of
sexual harassment experience.

Likelihood of Distressing and Non-Distressing Sexual Harassment by Sexual Orientation-Gender Identity
As shown in Table 5, after adjusting for influential characteristics identified in Table 4, heterosexual girls were 3.4 times
more likely to report distressing sexual harassment than heterosexual boys; elevated odds were also noted for bisexual
boys (Conditional odds ratio [COR] = 2.8, p < .001), bisexual girls (COR = 4.7, p < .001), questioning boys (COR = 3.2, p < .01),
questioning girls (COR = 4.2, p < .001), gay/queer boys (COR = 5.6, p < .001), and lesbian/queer girls (COR = 7.5, p < .001). Other
youth characteristics related to increased odds of distressing sexual harassment included having one or two or more romantic
partners, one or two or more sex partners, high depressive symptomatology, and experiencing high coercive discipline from
parents. Protective factors were also noted: Youth with high social support were less likely to report distressing sexual
harassment, as were youth with high self-esteem. Findings for youth reports of non-distressing sexual harassment followed
similar patterns, but conditional odds ratios were attenuated.
Likelihood of Distressing and Non-Distressing Sexual Harassment by Gender Identity
Youth identifying as female gender were 2.3 times more likely (95% CI [1.8, 2.9]) than male youth to report distressing
sexual harassment (Table 6). Transgender and gender non-conforming youth had an even higher likelihood of distressing
sexual harassment in comparison to male youth (COR = 6.5, COR = 5.6, respectively). All other factors were consistent with
those identified in the previous model. Factors related to non-distressing sexual harassment were attenuated but consistent
with those related to distressing harassment.

Discussion
Among youth ages 13 to 18 in the national Teen Health and Technology study, 23–72% of youth, depending on sexual
orientation and gender identity, were sexually harassed in the past year. Consistent with previous literature (Greytak et al.,
2009; Gruber & Fineran, 2008; Human Rights Campaign, 2012; Kosciw & Diaz, 2006; Williams et al., 2003), LGBT youth in the
current study reported victimization rates higher than their non-LGBT peers. Both sexual orientation and gender identity
seem to be key factors in understanding risk for sexual harassment in adolescence. Findings add to the existing literature by
identifying differences across specific sexual minority groups and providing much-needed information about under-studied
transgender youth.
The Unique Experience of the Female Gender
Most of the research that compares males and females in terms of their rates of sexual harassment are looking at biological
sex and indeed, biological sex does matter. That girls report more sexual harassment than boys has been previously noted
in large-scale, national studies in the United States (e.g., Finkelhor et al., 2013). Girls also experience sexual harassment
differently than boys, as they experience more unwanted comments, gestures, and touch (Chiodo, Wolfe, Crooks, Hughes,
& Jaffe, 2009b). Adolescent girls also consistently report more discomfort and negative consequences as a result of sexual
harassment than boys (Lee, Croninger, Linn, & Chen, 1996). The immediate and long-term outcomes associated with sexual
harassment are also often stronger and more negative for girls (Chiodo et al., 2009b).
Findings from this study add to this existing literature in several ways. First, we specifically explored rates of sexual
harassment by gender identity (i.e., the knowledge of oneself as being male or female). Transgender youth feel themselves
to be of a gender different from their biological sex, and cisgender youth feel themselves to be of a gender that is the same as
their biological sex. Second, our findings confirmed that this pattern of increased rates of sexual harassment for the female
sex extends to all youth of the female gender, regardless of sexual orientation: Female heterosexual youth reported higher
K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280–295 291
rates of sexual harassment and more distress than heterosexual males, bisexual girls more than bisexual boys, and lesbian
youth more than gay youth. Of particular interest, given our focus on sexual minority youth, is the motivational differences
behind same-sex versus opposite-sex sexual harassment (McMaster et al., 2002). For heterosexual youth, most oppositesex
harassment is partly motivated by sexual interest, whereas same-sex harassment is more likely to be motivated by
aggression.
Our data is limited in that we do not know the sex or motivation of the individuals behind the sexual harassment. Such
knowledge is a critical next step in better understanding the differential experience of sexual harassment among LGBT youth
and could play an important role in both primary and secondary prevention of sexual harassment for all youth.
Impact of Sexual Harassment
In many cases, youth who were sexually harassed did not report a significant impact in their ability to continue to function
in their daily lives as a result. For a notable number of youth, particularly sexual minority youth, however, the experience
affected their relationships with their friends and family and their school work. The harassment also made certain places
feel scary or uncomfortable. Given the disproportionate victimization experienced overall by LGBT youth, perhaps they are
more vulnerable to distress for a number of reasons. First, it could be that the impact of victimization compounds already
existing stress due to stigma associated with being a sexual minority. The literature certainly documents elevated levels
of emotional distress for LGBT youth, including depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation, and self-harm compared to
their heterosexual peers (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009; Robinson & Espelage, 2011, 2012). Such distress
is suggested to be a byproduct of the stigmatization associated with being a sexual minority in society (Martin-Storey &
Crosnoe, 2012). More research is necessary.
Second, victimized LGBT youth tend to come out earlier and be more visible (D’Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002)
and may be more gender-atypical (D’Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2006; D’Augelli et al., 2002). In the current study, bisexual
girls, lesbian/queer girls, and gay/queer boys reported particularly elevated odds of both distressing and non-distressing
sexual harassment; the same is true for gender non-conforming and transgender youth. Thus, “queerer” youth appear to
be more likely sexually harassed than others. Some adolescents may have a degree of social uneasiness with what they
perceive to be others’ sexual ambiguity, whether it be gender identity or sexuality or a combination of the two, and this
in turn becomes the impetus for the harassment. It amplifies the implicit message: You are different and it is because of
your sexuality. It may be too that one’s reaction to the victimization is affected by one’s stage of coming out or degree of
self-acceptance: Those who are less assured or confident may be worried that the harassment will in some way ‘out’ them.
Previous research has suggested that these youth are more concerned about the way they will be received by peers and family
when they disclose the experience (Carragher & Rivers, 2002; Ryan & Rivers, 2003). Studying the timing of sexual harassment
victimization in relation to these critical life events for LGBT youth is an important next step in our understanding of the
impact of victimization for this population. More generally, LGBT youth may personalize the victimization and attribute its
cause to their sexual orientation, a core part of their self, whereas heterosexual and cisgender youth may attribute the cause
to something external and less linked to their self and therefore feel victimization is easier to avoid in the future.
A third reason LGBT youth may be particularly likely to experience distress because of the sexual harassment may be
because LGBT youth are often subject to more intense victimization experiences (e.g., more targeted, more intrusive, more
severe; Dunbar, 2006). Examination of the specific details of the victimization incident itself would help determine this.
Research about youth experiences with other types of victimization supports this notion: Incident characteristics such as
being targeted by adults, being asked to send a picture of oneself, and attempts at offline contact were all related to increased
likelihood of distress among youth who were harassed online in a national survey (Ybarra et al., 2006).
Finally, fear could play a role in the elevated levels of distress as a result of sexual harassment for LGBT youth. Sexual
minority youth report high rates of feeling unsafe at school: 64% of LGBT youth felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation
and 44% because of their gender expression in the 2011 School Climate Survey (Kosciw et al., 2012). LGB youth are significantly
more likely than non-LGB youth to report being threatened with a weapon (DuRant, Krowchuk, & Sinal, 1998; Garafalo, Wolf,
Kessel, Palfrey, & DuRant, 1998), being involved in fights at school (DuRant et al., 1998), and have their property damaged
while at school (Garafalo et al., 1998). Accordingly, LGB youth are significantly more likely than non-LGB youth to report
missing school because they feel unsafe (Coalition for Education on Sexual Orientation, 2005; Garafalo et al., 1998). As a
result, LGBT youth may react differently and more intensely to any form of victimization which could add to these elevated
feelings of being unsafe. Our findings suggest that LGBT youth, and bisexual girls, gay/queer boys, and lesbian/queer girls
in particular, reported that places “feel scary, unfriendly or uncomfortable” as a response to the sexual harassment they
experienced. Even larger numbers of transgender and gender non-conforming youth reported this to be the case. Findings
suggest the importance of ensuring safety for all youth, and LGBT youth in particular. Having teachers and other school
personnel who are openly supportive of LGBT students is an important first step in helping to alleviate such fear, both in
terms of support for the LGBT student themselves and as role models for non-LGBT students. Teachers also need to intervene
and stop instances of sexual harassment. Indeed, research examining school climate for transgender youth found that when
schools took action to reduce harassment, students reported greater connections with school staff which were, in turn,
associated with greater feelings of safety (McGuire et al., 2010).

Other Factors Related to Distress
Given the potential for the victimization to have a lasting impact on youth development, it is critical to understand concurrent
influential factors contributing to an increased likelihood of victimization-related distress. Beyond sexual orientation
and gender identity, additional factors associated with distressing sexual harassment victimization emerged. Youth with
high depressive symptomatology were more than 2 times as likely to also report a distressing sexual harassment experience.
It may be that depressed youth are more likely to become distressed as a result of the sexual harassment; it may also be that
youth who are depressed are more likely to be sexually harassed because of some perceived or real vulnerability. Depression
could also be the outcome of distressing (and perhaps objectively more traumatic) sexual harassment. All scenarios likely
have a reality depending on the youth and the situation, although there is some support for sexual harassment to predict
lower self-esteem and symptoms of depression for females in 8th grade, three years later (Goldstein, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean,
& Eccles, 2007).
Sexual activity and romantic involvement were both associated with increased likelihood of concurrently reporting sexual
harassment generally, and distressing harassment specifically. Perhaps these youth are engaging in activities through which
they are exploring their sexuality, and unexpectedly find themselves in sexualized situations that they did not want. More
research is needed about how sexual harassment may fit into the potential continuum of healthy relationships.
Protective Factors Related to Reduced Likelihood of Distress
In line with previous research (Kosciw et al., 2012; Russell et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2005), protective factors also were
suggested: For all youth, LGBT and non-LGBT, high self-esteem was significantly associated with lower odds of reporting a
distressing sexual harassment experience in the past year. This supports other literature suggesting self-esteem is critical for
the well-being of LGBT youth. For example, students who experience higher levels of victimization (i.e., harassment, assault
in school) based on their sexual orientation or gender expression have lower levels of self-esteem than those who report
lower levels of the same types of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012). We also found youth with high levels of social support
were less likely to be distressed. LGBT youth may be particularly at a disadvantage because they often have less social support
and fewer resources to help them cope with the victimization experience (Almeida et al., 2009). Among a community-based
high school sample of LGBQ adolescents, sexual minority youth reported less social support from both peers and family
members than their heterosexual counterparts (Williams et al., 2005). Less than half (45.7%) of LGBT youth report that they
have a student club in their school that addresses LGBT student issues. Youth with more internal and external resources
appear to fare better when sexually harassed. It is also possible that people with high levels of social support or self-esteem
are protected from sexual harassment in the first place. Regardless of the directionality of the relationships which requires
further study, expanding the support network of LGBT youth, such as through online sources, may help bridge this gap in
support. Indeed, compared to heterosexual youth, LGB youth are more likely to say that their friendships online are better
than their in person friendships. This finding suggests that for some youth, the Internet can be a source of social support
(Ybarra, Palmer, Mitchell, & Reisner, in preparation).
Is the Internet a “Safer” Place for LGBT Teens?
The Internet does not appear to provide a level playing ground or a place where LGBT youth can necessarily be buffered
from the risk of sexual harassment that otherwise occurs in person. Indeed, after in person, sexual harassment was most
commonly reported as occurring online; this was true for youth of all sexual orientations and gender identities. In most
cases, rates of sexual harassment via text were about half as common as those occurring in person. Even as access to and
use of the Internet and text messaging continue to grow as a preferred communication between youth (Lenhart, 2012),
traditional victimization routes (i.e., in person) are by far more common. At the same time, technology is a means of sexual
harassment for youth and LGBT youth in particular. We found LGBT youth and lesbian/bisexual girls in particular reported
sexual harassment via the Internet. Text-messaging-based sexual harassment was also most commonly reported by these
groups of youth. Effective prevention efforts necessarily need to include online and text messaging-based scenarios but not
to the exclusion of content that targets in person interactions.
The Sexualized Nature of Bullying/Aggression
Researchers have begun to bridge the once distinct literature of sexual harassment and bullying (Espelage & Holt, 2007;
Miller et al., 2013; Shute, Owens, & Slee, 2008). Commonalities exist based on the nature or content of the bullying. Indeed,
research has found the bully victimization of girls by high school boys to be overwhelmingly sexual in nature (e.g., Shute
et al., 2008). Bullying and verbal harassment experienced by LGBT students in particular is often sexual in nature; and this
is especially true for harassment experienced by transgender people and lesbian and bisexual young women (Bochenek &
Brown, 2001). The majority of LGBT teens have been harassed specifically because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
Indeed, 82% were verbally harassed and 38% physically harassed because of their sexual orientation; 64% were verbally
harassed, and 27% physically harassed because of their gender expression (Kosciw et al., 2012). Overlap in victimization
experience also is noted. Youth who are victims of bullying report the highest rates of peer sexual harassment victimization
K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280–295 293
(Holt & Espelage, 2005; Ybarra et al., 2012). Further, bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing are significant predictors
of sexual harassment perpetration over time (Espelage, Basile, & Hamburger, 2012). A limitation of the current data is
the focus exclusively on sexual harassment. Additional bullying experiences were not included because the survey did not
allow for the disentanglement of sexualized and non-sexualized bullying. It is possible that higher rates of victimization and
associated impact would be noted if bullying also were included in the analyses.
Limitations
Additional limitations that need to be considered include the fact that this is a cross-sectional study, thus, temporality
cannot be determined. Whether social support buffered sexual harassment, or a positive response to sexual harassment
increased social support, for example, cannot be determined in the current data. Further, the data are national, but required
weighting to behave as if they were nationally representative. Selection bias in the unweighted data may exist because youth
in the HPOL sample were required to be affiliated with the HPOL and in the GLSEN sample because youth were recruited
through GLSEN networks. Although we took a cautious approach and are confident in our analytic strategies, findings should
be replicated in other national studies.
The data were self-reported online. There is a possibility that youth reports were not accurate because of, for example,
conscious or unconscious misreporting, or adults responding to the survey. Multiple procedures were used to encourage
honest and accurate reporting. For example, respondents were encouraged to complete the survey while alone in a safe
place and were ensured that their responses were confidential. Participants did not receive incentives for their participation,
reducing the benefit of completing the survey multiple times. The eligibility criteria, particularly the age range, were not
publicized so that potential respondents would know what the right answers would be to qualify for the survey. Thus, we
are confident that the data accurately reflect the characteristics and experiences of the youth who participated in this study.
Finally, a critical element to the understanding of sexual harassment among sexual minorities may be whether the
perpetrator is same- or opposite-sex, which cannot be determined within the current data. A better understanding of the
characteristics of the perpetrator would help us better understand the motives behind the harassment, including whether
sexual orientation was a key factor.
Conclusion
Findings add to the growing literature in the field of youth violence documenting increased risk for sexual harassment
among LGBT youth. This is true both in person, as well as in technology-based communications such as the Internet and
text messaging. Professionals should focus on the more nuanced differences in sexual harassment experiences among the
diverse groups of sexual minority youth. Motivations behind sexual harassment during adolescence are likely evolving and
need to be a focus of scrutiny, particularly among the complex developmental experiences of LGBT youth. Findings point to
the great importance of sexual harassment prevention for all adolescents, with a particular emphasis on the unique needs
and experiences of youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that emphasize
self-esteem building could be particular beneficial for reducing the likelihood of sexual harassment victimization as well as
lessen the impact when it occurs.
